    "selftext": "I’m thinking about either killing myself or just giving up on my future. I have been dealing with MCAS and a myriad of other diseases/medical issues for about as long as I can remember, and I officially can’t do it anymore. As I’m writing this I’m supposed to be at a haircut that my mom scheduled for me but I said I couldn’t go (I feel unbearably sick), so she took some of my money and said it was my fault because I stayed up late, said she wouldn’t take me to a haircut for another 3 months and left by herself. But maybe that’s just how I’m perceiving the situation. I’ve told her that I’m depressed and have been for a very long time (this was incredibly hard for me to say). I despise therapy and always have but that’s the only solution I’m given. My father isn’t in the picture and my family live across the ocean. Currently I haven’t showered in about a week and a half, brush my teeth once a day, don’t work out, don’t eat, hardly sleep and feel suicidal. I turn 15 in 12 days, so maybe I’ll do it then. I’ve been ill with MCAS for almost around 1.5-2 years and haven’t gotten better, I haven’t seen any of my friends in almost a year, and hardly leave the house. I literally have nothing to live for. As soon as she left I started writing this post and sobbing. My life has no passion or joy in it, and it’s been like this for years. I don’t know what to do anymore, this illness might not kill me but it might make me kill myself instead. I don’t know if I’d even have the strength to take my own life. I rely on everyone else to help me because of how physically weak I’ve become. I copy and pasted this from the MCAS subreddit (my post) hoping maybe someone here or there would be able to help me. This is a potential cry for help ",

No suicidal thoughts have occurred but I have have not been able to sleep for very long before I wake up stressing about everything again. It takes forever to get back to sleep. I normally just push through but it has gotten to the point that I have fallen asleep at work. I need to get this to stop. I need my concentration back. I need to sleep through the night. What can I do to help myself get through this faster? I had a session with my therapist a couple days before this started. Everything was avtually going pretty well before this.

    "selftext": "I have been suffering for years, so long. I cant really remember a time since about 15 years old that I haven't struggled with depression, crippling anxiety and suicidal thoughts. But the last 2 years have been the worst its ever been. I dont have happy days, only happy moments. I do not go a single day without wishing I were dead. I've tried therapy, ive tried medication. Nothing works for me so far. I dont even want to continue answering the little mental health surveys honestly anymore because theres no point. They ask me about the answers and tell me they can put me on meds. No one really cares.\n\n\nI know that the thing fueling my depression has been my relationship with my boyfriend. I still cant find in it me to end it. It feels like a catch 22, because I need mental strength to leave him, but I can't ever find that strength because of how awful he makes me feel. I also have no desire to have a future, so its not like im hoping to go find someone better to \"spend my life with\" because mentally that life isnt going to happen. \n\n\nI've never before felt so completely worthless and like a waste of space here. I cant even wish for life to end because I know my mother wouldn't be able to handle it. Im living for her, and for my pets. That's all Im here for. It feels awful to be forced to continue suffering for someone else's happiness because I want nothing more than the suffering to end. \n\n\nHes the worst person I've ever personally known. Hes cruel. Its sincerely shocking to know that someone can go from being so loving and sweet, to a heartless monster in just a couple of years. He regularly tells me how much he doesn't want to be with me when hes angry at me. I couldnt tell you how many times I've heard how unwanted I am. Of course if this were consistent it'd be easier for me to walk away but it changes as soon as he's not mad. Then he loves me so much and of course he wants to be with me. \n\n\nToday was my 28th birthday. I spent the day working. But birthdays have always been special to me. I always make sure he feels loved on his birthdays. I get him gifts, a card, and I always get him a box of cookies from this place he likes. We got into a (*fight*) which just means he blew up angry while I spoke calmly to him, and he spent the night shitting on me again. Countless pleas of please dont do this today, on my birthday, were met with \"yeah its unfortunate\". Screaming at me, punching things, telling me to \"shut the fuck up\". Told me to \"put my big girl pants on\" while I was crying. Mocking me. \n\n\nAll because I told him it would mean a lot to me if he would make a post on Facebook for my birthday. I wish it were more than that, but that's all. \n\n\nI know this man will be the end of me some day. He will probably celebrate. Saying I hate myself is an understatement. I would say I dont know what to do, but its more like i dont know how to find it in me to do it. I dont think I ever will. Funny because some girls grow up wanting to be a mom but I've always wanted to be a wife. I've always fantasized about living my life with my best friend every day. I've always been enamored with movies with a love story because thats all I've ever wanted. I just know that it isnt in the cards for me. Not everyone gets a happily ever after, and Im one of the unlucky ones. Happy birthday to me. ",

I fear that if I drop out, my dad who already doesn’t have much time left is gonna be extremely dissapointed and his condition might worsen even more, moreover my entire family will be dissapointed as well. However if I keep going at my current Uni rate I’m gonna end up dying within a few months. If anyone took their time to read this, what do you think I should do, explain everything to my mom and see her reaction, or just continue with Uni?",

I feel that not looking for the real answers prevents me from finding real solutions. \n\nI feel that I was dealt really bad cards and was never at the same level as my peers but everyone treated me like it's my fault and on purpose and I'm just lazy and difficult. I always feel like I learnt to not do anything ever, not try...  I guess I'm in my comfort zone, I live in my head, food, videos, movies, books, social media... I feel like even when I have tried to be in the real world people act like I'm weird for feeling slightly confused by everything, I feel like an alien, I am not used to being included so when I am, I am weird at best ... I haven't built the basics for myself because I get discouraged really easily...  I think my anxiety gets really activated when I have to face people... I've heard social anxiety comes from shame... sometimes I feel like it is the case but my social anxiety is mostly caused by not knowing how to go about just being there without having people judge me...\n\nI got bullied at school and at home when I was in elementary school, by 12 I was severely depressed, told a teacher she said it's not true because I am so young... I tried to kill myself at the beginning of the next school year. I thought I was in trouble so I tried to act super happy and like everything is fine so I never got the help I could have gotten... I didn't tell on my parents... I wish I had... it had been years of my mom saying how \"they are not here to help\" ... I didn't think they would save me...  I have such a hard time making a timeline.... my psych gave me a chance to finally explain myself but I lost it.. my brain is scrambled...\n\nI can't do anything not even post this is so frustrating...",

I have had severe depression ever since, unable to cope. \n\nNow, it’s like I don’t think about him as much, but there’s always a dull ache in my chest. Every day is hard, every breath and every moment. Things are getting better in my life: I’ve lost some weight (healthily), I’m eating better, I got a better job that pays better, I’m finally getting a nicer place with cheaper rent. \n\nDespite all these things; depression stops for nobody. Nothing has changed. I still struggle with my bills and I still struggle to grapple with working 40 hours a week. \n\nI sabotage myself through sleep. I will scroll on my phone for hours, *looking* for something to do so I won’t sleep. I’m doing it now. I show up to work like a zombie about to keel over. Nobody knows because I smile when they see me. How embarrassing would it be to collapse at work? I would be a liar if I said I didn’t fantasize about it.  \n\nI’m so tired. and drained. Yet, I know how much better I feel when I sleep. When I’m not exhausted and constantly yawning, on this itch to crawl into my bed. When I sleep, life feels so beautiful and worth it. \n\nBut again and again, despite craving this feeling, I don’t sleep. Why is that? Am I obsessed with the familiarity of this depression? Is it self-harm? Am I rationalizing it? That, so long as I’m not scarred or daydreaming about walking off a building, I’m not harming myself? \n\nI am withdraw socially, I am so angry with the world and constantly irritable. I feel lightheaded and fatigued all the time. Sometimes at work, I feel myself drifting off standing up or walking. \n\nI am somebody who would never be able to kill myself. I am too scared. I fear pain and I fear death. And I fear that sin of following in my fathers footsteps, I could never put my family through that. But slowly, I feel like I’m killing myself.

I (34f) have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 12 but this is the first year I have seriously dealt with suicidal thoughts and formulated an actual plan. \n\nI tried therapy for a few years and I tried a few different therapists but that just succeeded in making me more stressed and more depressed somehow (and I had to pay $50 a session for the privilege). I just didn’t feel like it was good for me to keep bringing up traumas and dwelling on them. Meds helped for a while but they have stopped working as well. This year my doctor has switched my meds a couple times but the suicidal thoughts just keep creeping in. \n\nI am not close with my family for lots of reasons  and I really don’t have any friends, admittedly by my own actions (people can’t hurt you if you don’t let them in, right??). I don’t have any kids - I can barely take care of myself sometimes and no innocent child should have to be subjected to my mental health issues. The one thing I do have is a great husband but I can’t move past thinking that he would be better off without me. I have 2 cats that I adore but they would be just fine with my husband who adores them just as much. I do have a great relationship with a couple coworkers but they have to be around me and I would be replaced in a heart beat if I wasn’t there. We have also never done anything outside of work- if they left I doubt the relationship would survive. \n\nI don’t find much joy in anything anymore - the hobbies I do have involve escaping reality (fantasy books, video games, etc). I just dread the monotony of life- work, home, chores, workout, chores, tv, sleep repeat with no end in sight. \n\nI don’t know what exactly I am trying to say here but I am just hoping to connect with people who understand. I am seriously struggling to find a reason to keep going and I don’t know what else to try. I just feel like I can’t do 30-50 more years of this. It actually sounds like torture. ",

    "selftext": "(TW: Suicidal talk)\n\nBasically a week ago, I made a bunch of posts on the suicidewatch subreddit, I think I was definitely depressed, but I wasn’t actually suicidal.. I think I thought the only way people would realize I was regretful/sorry for the stuff I did in my past was if I say I was suicidal.. I really wanted someone to hear me.. I have in the past week intentionally thought about how I’d kill myself.. if I had certain things I could do it.. I know I’m VERY depressed now and it’s hard to do anything.. I definitely intentionally think about suicide, but I know don’t want to die, and I wouldn’t kill myself.. it’s difficult.. \n\nSo, someone messaged me after they saw one of my posts on the suicidewatch subreddit, and they said something like.. “hi I saw your post I also want to kms too for stuff/regret/ or my actions in my past..” and I SWEAR in that same message they said or somehow implied something about wanting to talk to me.. like.. “want to talk about it together?..” I think I also struggle with false memory OCD so this makes me panic.. I said “sure..” in response because again, I SWEAR they said or somehow implied something about wanting to talk to me.. I KNOW I would NOT say.. “sure..” if they ONLY said.. “I want to/ I’m going to kms too..” I KNOW I WOULD NOT say “sure..” to that, as I don’t want ANYONE to die.. so IF they did say “want to talk about it together?..” I KNOW I would have ONLY thought their “it” meant me talking to them about my issues and regrets.. I KNOW I wouldn’t say “sure..” to them if I KNEW they were actually saying or implying that we should both kill/harm ourselves together, or they should kill/harm themselves.. as I DO NOT want THEM to kill/harm themselves.. I DO NOT want ANYONE to kill/harm themselves.. and now, my OCD is like.. oh, but what if they took you saying “sure..” as a sure for them to go kill/harm themselves?!.. but the only thing I remember they said in their next message was.. “I’m still going to kill myself either way ifyky..” it was something like that.. so, if they did actually take my “sure..” in the wrong way then the majority of their next message would have to be more heart dropping or shocking and I’d then remember it.. also, them saying something like.. “I’m still going to kill myself either way ifyky..” doesn’t make sense if they did take my “sure..” in the wrong way because why would they say “STILL” then?.. and, my “sure..” ONLY meant to talk to them about my issues and regrets, because again, I SWEAR they said or somehow implied something about wanting to talk to me.. so, after they said something like.. “I’m still going to kill myself either way ifyky..” I then said.. “what happened?..” and they started talking about their bad behaviour?.. or something.. but eventually after that I muted/hid the messages with them.. I might have done that out of regret?.. like.. “I don’t think I should have messaged them..” or it was out of fear/panic/worry/anxiety.. or it was something.. like.. “maybe I shouldn’t have messaged them at all..” somewhere they also MIGHT’VE asked me what all my issues were, and I said something like.. “pretty much everything I said in my post..” but I’m not 100% sure if that one specific part happened..\n\nI’ve been panicking for about a week.. it’s made me more depressed.. my OCD keeps saying stuff like.. oh but what if they took you saying “sure..” in the the wrong way?!.. but I’m like.. if they took my “sure..” in the wrong way I’d remember what the majority of their next message said, but instead the only thing I remember they said in it was.. “I’m still going to kill myself either way ifyky..” which doesn’t make sense if they took my “sure..” in the wrong way.. because why would they say “STILL” then?.. I KNOW I’m not stupid.. but my brain says.. what if you SOMEHOW accidentally overlooked what they said?!.. but again, my “sure..” ONLY meant to talk to them about my issues and regrets, because again, I SWEAR they said or somehow implied something about wanting to talk to me.. \n\nI just REALLY hope they are alive and well.. I don’t know what to do..\n",

But after that attempt (which was almost 7 months ago) I lived on thinking suicide wouldn't change much anyway and that it was all pointless. Only a few of my friends know that I have been depressed for some time. But I never told anyone about the failed attempt I had and I plan on not doing so. \n\nAnyways, \n\nThis constant state of depression has made me isolated. I spend most of my days alone and it's really not healthy for me. I just started to randomly cry at times first. But then I became angrier for no apparent reason. I hate myself for thinking about how I could murder people close to me. There was only one friend I have talked all of those with. But she is a suicidal and has a history of self harm. Even that makes me feel disgusted of myself since I'm using her to dump my troubles while she is the one that needs and deserves the things she does for me. (There is no apparent reason for my depression. Just thinking a lot made me like this while she had to go through a lot with things like her health and family problems.) \n\nI fell like I'm just holding everyone around me and I'm just too disgusting of a person to change it. (I have tried to change over and over again. I didn't wanted to choke myself for a week in the last two years at best)\n\nThere are also some other things wrong with my head probley caused by lack of sleep. You guys can't even imagine how many times I have heard my name while being all alone or how many times I saw a damn cat walking towards me before it dissapeared. There are also other things like my addictions. Mostly to porn and sometimes a huge urge of getting alcohol even though I will probley not get drunk enough to forget shit. \n\nThis was more a dump session now that I look at it.  ",

I talked to her about work, I know she hates it but it's how she's paying for her car and phone bill, and they're paying for her schooling, so from an outsider perspective I worry that they'll fire her and she'll lose these benefits, luckily they really like her and have given her as much time as she needs. And if she did lose her job I'd do everything in my power to support her, I'd try to take over her bills and pay for the rest of her school.

    "selftext": "To start from the beginning here my girlfriends been dealing with depression along 4-5 years now as well as an ED 3-4 of those. She’s been up and she’s been down but within the last 3 of those years it’s been getting progressively, slowly worse, I’ve only been with her for 1 1/2 of those years but during that time it’s head it’s head. She was admitted into a facility a couple months back with mid 30 bpm and severely underweight (this is post us getting her in with a team of specialists to help her get better) and when she was back from the facility back up to a normal heart rate and in her bmi range she was getting better, it was hard but she pushed through every single day and she was getting better. But recently, I’m not sure why exactly yet she started declining. Post her stay at that facility she had become more open about her suicidal ideation, it was alarming to hear as it’s never anything I’d heard of even at that point nor a concept I’d have considered for a person but she expressed it won’t go away and she’s just like that- but is that really true ? She expresses at the same time sometimes when she’s feeling good things that are the opposite of “everything is hopeless and drab and blah” which is albeit kind of confusing cause I wonder if even though she’s not expressing that she still thinks it (she says everything is beautiful and looks at nature and appreciates it but inside of her she is still hopeless) I think for a while she’s thought about the end of her life. She’s attempted SH in the earliest years of her depression but her mom got a handle on it ie removing sharp objects keeping watch on her taking pills etc. but for Her she expressed it wasn’t for her in the first place and was ashamed to have given it thought. But she’ll talk about suicide sometimes casually and everytime I don’t ever really know what to say I can draw her away from it but I know that me “drawing her away” is just her not talking about it anymore and that’s not exactly…. Helpful… i don’t mind her talking about anything but it’s more so the act that I just don’t know how to help with. All of this heading by she tried to actually take her own life yesterday, she took all of her antidepressants and I believe half a bottle of ibuprofen, but after the fact she went to her mom (all of this happens within maybe 5 minutes or less) and shows her the empty bottles, prior to this she had told her mom goodbye essentially but her mom didn’t catch it I guess. Her mom rushes her to the hospital and they give her charcoal and put her on 24 hour hold (as of right now it’s 72 hour 5150) she’s never tried anything like this. She had been calling me and I would talk to her but she would just say she misses me but when I was with her she seemed absent, she had just gotten a second job and expressed to me at her other job that sometimes she wishes she was dead so she wouldn’t have to come into work and to line up with that she did this right before she had to clock into the second job. I just don’t know what to do, I love her with all of my heart but admittedly I didn’t sign up for this. I won’t leave her but I want her to get better and I just want to understand, she knows I don’t understand it the way she feels it but I try my hardest. I’m upset and I can’t feel anything and I’m upset that I can’t even feel anything because I know she’s going through minor hell in that hospital right now and I don’t even know what to say to her, I just need anything.

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\n6 weeks ago I made the decision to start weaning off sertraline. I was first prescribed it for depression when I was 18 years old so have been on it for 17 years now. I’ve had a couple of years now of feeling emotionally really well and have made significant lifestyle changes and breakthroughs that I feel have contributed hugely to this. I therefore felt comfortable coming off sertraline feeling that now I had such a good handle on various external factors contributing to low mood, I might feel even happier still without them blunting my emotions and having an overall numbing effect.\n\nThe doctor advised I wean down from my original 50mg dose over the course of 3 months, reducing by 25% each time using liquid sertraline instead of the tablet. I made the initial drop to 37.5mg and felt no noticeable difference until about 2-3 weeks in, when I was hit with a major depressive episode I can only liken to how I felt as a teenager, before I was ever treated for depression. I’m usually a very easygoing person but have become extremely angry, embittered and am pushing away all those close to me. I am crying constantly and feel completely hopeless and filled with existential angst, tipping into suicidal ideation (which I have no intention of acting upon, just plagued by the idea of it). \n\nI know these types of withdrawals are very common and kept insisting to myself and those around me that this was temporary, but it got to the point yesterday where I was filled with such angst and despair that I completely broke down and knew I had to go back to my original dose. I have started this morning back on 50mg and wondered if anyone had ever experienced something similar and could tell me how long it took for them to feel themselves again when they resumed treatment?\n\nI am also wondering if I’ll ever be able to wean off this medication given how long I’ve been on it and the severity of the withdrawals - has anyone had any success and what methods helped you?\n\nThanks all",

    "selftext": "I'm a 29 yr old (m) and I once tried to drink myself to d**th when I was 19. I think I've contemplated it as a solution for my social,financial, and spiritual struggles for a long time. And in the last year, the burdens of my family have fallen squarely on my shoulders and I haven't exactly handled it well. I should explain that my mother is a bipolar schizophrenic, who gave me her power of attorney etc when I was 19 because she didn't trust her own mind, during her first severe manic episode where she refused to sleep for 9 days, and just started to behave increasingly bizarre. Leaving the stove on and blaming neighbors we had never even spoken to,building strange monuments out of household objects. Stuff like that. Until I brought her to a hospital. I thought she had a brain tumor. I had never seen her behave like that before. I only later found out that it was because my grandparents told her they were going to sell our house that she had paid nearly 70k into from the hair salon business she started by herself. For over 200k. They moved us onto a shittier property they also owned. I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but it was a single wide trailer. And they forced me to leave my hometown in order to keep looking after my mother. And move to Tucson. Which I hate. But I tried to make the most of it. Build a relationship with my grandparents.(they weren't interested). My grandparents had largely written off my mother before I was born. Due to her mental health struggles they assumed she was merely a drug addict. Not a victim of trauma and abuse. Which they knew she was abused by her uncle they just again brushed that off. Anyway they basically treated me like a mental invalid my entire life. Never attempting to connect with me in any meaningful way. Often speaking to me like I was stupid. But they loved my cousin, we'll call him Larry. Larry was their golden grandson, cause I believe they felt they had screwed up all of their kids, and were going to sort of make up for it with their investment in him and his future. Basically they put all of their faith in Larry. None in me. They actually accused me of being a drug dealer when I was 15, and I only smoked weed. Which Larry got me into. I never resented Larry for the way they favored him, he was the closest thing I have ever had to a big brother. He loved me enough to tell me the truth even though he knew it would likely upset me, in the interest of helping me move past my issues and improve myself. I really admired that about him. Fast forward about 9 years to when my grandparents are nearing death. They make it clear that my mom won't be left the property they've allowed us to live on. Claiming they were worried my mom wouldn't be able to afford the taxes. They end up leaving everything they have to Larry, assuring he will always allow my mom to stay on the property so she won't be homeless. I didn't care. I assumed my brother would keep his word and try to honor the wishes of my grandparents who gave him so much, and put so much faith in him.. once my grandfather died. They got my grandmother to sign a conservitorship and forced her into a home in less than 4 months. They gave her basically no time to grieve a 63 year marriage partner. But once they had the conservitorship signed, my cousin and my aunt started to move forward with serving my mother eviction notices. Before my grandmother even died. And Larry started to only communicate with me through lawyer letters. And also while all this was happening, my sister was struggling with a Xanax and opoid addiction. So when my mom gets the eviction notice, she tells me she took a whole bottle of her psych meds. So I have to have her admitted to a psych ward again. After being cleared at the hospital. At this point I believe it was the 4th or 5th time I've had to do so. So during that 2 weeks my mom was in the psych ward, I had to flake on my roomate and rent to pay for a moving truck to move my mom, and her 8 or so cats back to my home town. And ended up moving in with my childhood best friend for the past year+. His mom also took in my mom's cats because she couldnt bring them to a rental. I was prepared to doom them all to be euthanized. And they are all old cats atleast 10 years old. Basically my friend and his mom are saints. I've been giving pretty much all the money I make to my mother for her rent and car payments. Because my sister decided to go out drinking with her old besty when we got up here, and she lost her easy access to Xanax. Basically OD'd on tramadol and alchohol and had a series of severe seizures that gave her brain damage, and now she behaves like a 80 yr old woman with dementia. And shes 32. She doesn't know where she lives. What year it is. And lives in a state of constant despair. I've tried to get her on disability but to say it's been a struggle would be an understatement. And I am not wealthy. I do not have a good job. I stock shelves at Safeway and Doordash on the weekends sometimes. I'm too physically drained and depressed to aspire to do anything more than just \"get by\". I know I have people who believe in me. And are counting on me to get better, and make something of myself that can ease these burdens. I just don't have much in my life that makes dealing with all of this burden feel worth it. I have my best friend, and that's about it. My mom gave me a great childhood, so I will always try my best to support her. My sister is frankly ungrateful for everything I've done for her since she has become disabled, and talks about suicide daily. But lies about it when I tell her doctors. She does nothing but make my life difficult and unpleasant. She even lied to her crisis team I called for her and told them I hit her to get revenge because she thought I called the cops on her. My mom told them she was lying. If she hadn't, I wouldve been charged with DV. Just for trying to help her. And the fact that Larry, wants nothing to do with me, because he's ashamed of how he acquired his fortune (north of 500k atleast). Really fucking hurts. And to pile on I should mention I haven't touched a woman since I was 16. My ex fiance who I met in kindergarten, at the time ended up cheating on me, and I thought the other guys kid might be mine for 9 months,I really wanted it to be mine. I haven't been able to be intimate with a woman since. I've had some dates, some light frisky action since. But I always cut and run, I never let them get close enough to see that they don't actually want me. That is the key to lasting loneliness. \n\nIf your still here I should tell you, I'm sorry for ranting. But I just fealt a need to get some of this out. I can't afford therapy obviously. And talking to ai therapists just makes me more depressed. But I am still fighting my depression. I don't want to give up. But at the same time I do. I get upset at how unfair life is. I hate my life. But I'm also grateful to be alive. To have even the smallest possibility of turning it around. A large part of me thinks that's just me being foolish. But it's the only part of my idealistic inner child, who wanted nothing but to be a super hero, that is still alive within me. And losing that part of myself would make me want to die. But I'm sick of craving death. And I want it to stop. I want the self hatred and disappointment I have in myself to stop. I want to stop wishing things were different and just \"man up\" and MAKE the fucking difference. But most of the time. It feels too hard. So I let the depression get the best of me. I've let so much of my life slip away by doing that and I just want to put a fucking stop to it.",

I just waste my time with distractions to keep me from dwelling on how much I hate myself. I can't keep living like this. Another year of retail like this and I'm gonna burn out so bad. I don't want to talk to people and at the same time I'm so fucking lonely.\n\nI'm a fucking piece of shit and I should die. Just someone fucking kill me already.

My adult hood hasn’t been that much better either. I’ve had some wins. For one, I’m sober now. It’s been a year and 3 months now. I’m an alcoholic so most of us don’t make it this far. And for that I am proud. I won’t lie though, it didnt do much to improve the depression I feel every day. And I really thought it would. I’m doing the steps and go to meetings (though I have stopped going to as many as I probably should). I’m medicated for my depression, anxiety, and adhd. Still I get into these absolutely horrible spirals. I’m sure you guys can relate. Lately I’ve started getting back into religion, the meaning of life, so on and so forth. I’m in therapy as well. Still I feel so very empty. I have a boyfriend who I love very much. Tomorrow is actually our 3 year anniversary. But I know that he’s getting tired from my constant problems. I can get angry and be kind of an ass I’ll admit. I know that I complain a lot. I’m just so fucking sad all the time. He supports me right now, and it makes me fucking hate myself. I’m not a stupid person, but I get so overwhelmed. I’ve had countless jobs over the years that I’ve either quit or been fired from. I’m super on top of things in the beginning. Then suddenly everything starts piling up. I can’t deal with the little things that used to not bother me. And then I end up calling in too many times. Getting fired or quitting all together. The thing is, I want a normal life. I want to do things, I want to be happy. I can’t figure it out. Life seems like this super complicated game and I didn’t understand the tutorial. I just want to get it. Like other people do. Get up go to work, have friends, be happy. But I don’t understand. Everything feels forced. Especially social interaction. I live my boyfriend but I even find myself feeling robotic around him. Just going through the motions. Simply existing like I’m acting out a scene I’ve rehearsed. That is until I can’t anymore, and I break down. Which is where I’m at currently. My boyfriend is expecting to get some money soon and I want to die before he does. I know he will want to spend some of it on me, but I don’t deserve that. I want him to go on and lead a happy life. I don’t think he can do that with me around. My mom is elderly and I lived for her for many years because I didn’t want her to be alone. But her health is declining. She is my only family. Once I’m gone I know she will be sad, but I’ll see her soon after that. I am still debating how I will go. I don’t want to do it in a way that traumatizes anyone. I don’t want my ending my pain to contribute to someone else’s. I wish I knew what was wrong with me. I’ve spent my whole life trying to fix it. I’m hurting people by being this way. The only way to fix it is to take myself out. ",

I have bipolar 1 disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. \n\nI have a huge fear of the unknown and obviously this applies not only to my future but to death as well. I have been on 3 or 4 5150s (honestly they tend to blur together after a while) but not one for 7 years, a fact I’m very proud of. I have no plans to harm myself or others. Or even thoughts of them. \n\nBut I want a way out. I am physically disabled. Because of this I had to leave a job I was at for 11 years and very good at and take a 50% pay cut to work in an office at a job I hate, where I’m treated like crap, and I can barely pay rent in a good month. I have to miss about a day a week (approved time off always) due to health appointments both physical and mental. I’ve been there eight months and have never taken a vacation day ever. \n\nI am in a ton of debt and I’m two classes away from graduating with my bachelors after being in college for 17 years, most of which I was unmedicated and made poor decisions and didn’t finish classes for which I blame myself. \n\nI have doubts if my ADHD will allow me to finish my degree by December which I’m hoping to be done by. For a lot of different reasons. \n\nI’m engaged to the most wonderful and supportive woman I’ve ever met but I struggle regardless because my life sucks so much. I can’t afford for us to live together (she lives on disability for her auto immune disorder) or be able to take care of her. This depresses me. \n\nMy landlords are a nosy elderly couple. The wife is the worst. She has early stage dementia and goes into my room when I’m not there to make sure things are up to her standard, ie: no clothes anywhere but hanging up or in the hamper. They don’t let me eat in my room but have made it known they’ve always let other renters. They make comments about what I eat and so I typically don’t eat in front of them. I’ve lost forty pounds because of this. \n\nShe complains about how I do laundry so I just use a laundry service or buy new clothes when I can afford them. When I help out around the house she calls me “the hired help” and “a good house boy”. \n\nI know that completing my degree is the best way to a better life but it’s so hard to force myself to work on it when my job drains my soul and I’m exhausted because of my physical disabilities and all I want to do after work is sleep. I’ve lost all interest in just about everything. \n\nI live in constant fear of ever being homeless again, which I was for 3 weeks in 2021 when my best friend conspired against me to turn my roommates into believing he’d make the better roommate and they, while leaving me on the lease, kicked me out illegally. My cat, who I gave to another friend for safekeeping, ended up sneaking out for what I can only assume was to try to get back to me and was never heard from again. I blame myself. \n\nI pray ceaselessly that the things I do have never be taken away from me and that I never end up as badly as I was four years ago. \n\nI wish I knew how to medicate my ADHD but stimulants are risky because of my enlarged heart and Strattera causes hallucinations. I’m so lost. Oh Gd the PTSD can be so bad. My fiancée on the nights I spend at her mom’s house says I often sound like I’m trying to scream from the nightmares I get they’re so intense. My past haunts me like my shadow. \n\nSomeone please offer advice, help me heal and help me to be able to graduate to get a better life ",

I'm a third child of four I have two big sisters (30F and 25F) who are the meanest people you could ever meet they bully me and my little sister belittle us laugh at us and spread false info about us to their friends and my parents favor them even though they don't respect them in any way (not that my parents deserve respect but on the contrast i respect them and they treat me like shit). my parents are like the wrost parents you could ever ask for, my mother (53F) is a Stockholm syndrome type of person my father (63M) a narcissistic asshole cheated on her multiple times since the stone age and speaks horribly about her and her body and us to the women he cheats on her with and treats her and us like shit doesn't pay for anything and she doesn't give a crap and acts like her marriage is perfect and takes her anger and stress out on me and my little sister. my father is a crazy lunatic with a high ego he's abusive physically when i was a kid and mentally when I'm now an adult he doesn't believe in mental health and doesn't even treat us for physical illnesses and the same treatment goes for my little sister (19F) my little sister was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was 14 she started using the bathroom alot and her injuries wouldn't heal when me and her voiced our concerns my parents and sisters made fun of her for using the bathroom so much, eventually they decided to do a sugar blood test when my oldest sister said it mockingly. after it was confirmed that she has type 1 diabetes my father scolded her for eating so much and that she caused it to herself (mind you she was 47kg at the time) and my father has diabetes too and he feels bad for himself more than his child and he has some odd behaviors with me and my little sister like commenting on the size of our butts or the way we walk and sometimes he smacks our butts and says it was a joke i got furious one time and he yelled at me with my mom defending him (yes she did) also we did tell my mom about that and instead of being concerned she started yelling and telling us that we're perverts and sick in the head for thinking about our father like that. these are my issues and this is as tame as I can put it my depression hasn't been specifically diagnosed since my father is refusing to pay for my mental health treatment cause he doesn't believe in it and i haven't finished any treatment and a part of that is a personal decision as well since I couldn't get better in the same environment that got me ill (they shame me and my sister for eating sleeping and laughing). I started experiencing depressive symptoms when I was 14 and opened up to my mother about it when I was 18 because there was so much BS going on in my home life that a human can't imagine and it took me a while to open up because I come from a society where mental health is something to be ashamed of and just a myth or some shit. I think I have chronic severe depression i tried several medications in my short time of treatment nothing was working and I don't know if it's because of me or the environment around me. I struggle with SH aswell. I graduated high school in 2020 and haven't done anything with my life ever since. I don't have a job I'm socially awkward due to my parents neglecting and abusive behaviors I have anxiety i have no friends and no relatives I'm broke and in a very dark place. heavy suicidal tendencies but the only thing stopping me is my little sister she's the world to me and I fear death just because I wouldn't see her again. I don't care about myself. as you might have guessed I'm from an Arab country and not the few stable ones there's no system to help me I have only myself and my sister and my only escape is to force myself to work and try to go to a forgein contury but I don't know where to start and how to do things in life. me and my sister are severely abused mentally and emotionally and I feel like the physical abuse is not far now. we need advice. sorry if the post is a messy confusing random rant but i needed to briefly explain my situation that led to this. I typed this after a big fight with my shitty dad about locking our bedroom door (sorry for my English).",

    "selftext": "My life has been shit. Its been shit since the moment I was conscious enough to register I was alive. My parents decided to pack their decent, middle income life up in Mexico and illegally immigrate to the USA in 2007 while I was 6 months old. My dad was offered a prime opportunity for a chemical engineering job in the USA and as soon as we came here, the offer and whole company he worked for fell through without a word to him about it. My parents, brother, and I would stay living in a hotel for a year or two while my dad worked multiple fast food and dishwasher jobs as his doctorates degree was deemed worthless in the US and he couldnt speak very much English. My mother was reduced to babysitting, and custodial jobs as her masters degree was also of no use and English was out of the picture for her. After two years of jumping from hotel to hotel, we secured an apartment and lived in it for ten years as my parents couldnt afford much else. My Dad started working for his brother who was in the process of getting a greencard and came here a couple years before despite being younger than my dad. He worked for his brother in his construction business, having known nothing about it and suffering various health problems of working manual labor jobs while being older. Soon enough he started freelancing and working for himself as his brother was refusing to pay him what he promised him and still to this day refuses to sponsor my dads greencard despite him being family and using him for underpaid labor. When I was around 7 years old and me and my parents attended a small catholic church regularly for years, I was raped by one of the lead pastors son. Very quickly after I spiraled into deep depression, and I became selectively mute and wouldn't speak or maintain conversations or friendships until 10 years old. By 11 years old I had attempted suicide for the first time, and was very quickly hospitalized. I had been diagnosed bipolar very shortly after my 12th birthday and second mental hospitalization an was put on psychiatric meds and attended therapy regularly. We were still living in the same apartments infested with roaches, bed bugs, fleas, and water that would come out dirty at least once a week. We wouldnt move out of them until 2020 before covid had started and I was 14 years old. My parents managed to work their ass off and send my brother who is 7 years older than me off to college in a different city while managing to pay for his studies as well as his own apartment. After a year and a half in college, my brother had to return home as he had failed his second semester and would not be able to graduate. My brother had told my parents he had finished and gotten his degree and he was returning home as he looked for a job. My parents didnt find out what really happened until they snooped around and found out my brother had never finished his second semester, nonetheless get any form of degree. They still let him live at home under the promise he'll actually try to get an education, and will be more honest with them. My brother wasnt and still isnt. He does heavy drugs and since 2020, he still lives at home. Around 2020 when my brother came home, I was struggling heavily in online school (covid era) and was deep in the midst of a self harm addiction. After finding out about my struggles my brother would constantly berate me asking why I was doing this to my family and saying how much of a burden I was and that I needed to get over myself. This would cause frequent arguments from middle school covid era up until the end of highschool. The verbal fights would only ever happen while my parents were working and they would get so bad he would start hitting and banging on my door. and eventually, he hit me for the first time. he only ever did it twice. I never spoke to him again after the second. Throughout highschool I struggled with attending classes due to my mental health as well as unexplained physical health problems, which ended up being due to complications with my PCOS and suicide attempts. Junior year of highschool I was doing a lot better mentally and was finally in a more stable place and was able to attend school regularly. I got into my first relationship that lasted a year, and a month or two after my first relationship I entered another one. This relationship ended up being extremely unhealthy as my then partner would constantly manipulate, use me, and verbally abuse me. this relationship lasted another year on and off, and as soon as I ended it, a male friend I had took advantage of me. He pressured me into a relationship and would constantly pressure me into unwanted sex, we were together less than 6 months before he broke up with me. A week after he broke up with me, I found out I was pregnant and suffered a miscarriage at 17 in February. Despite this, I managed to graduate highschool four months early, a month after I had the miscarriage. I started working immediately after graduating, and thats when my relationship with my family became worse. I kept arguing with them. about how they wouldn't be able to afford me going to college and now that I had a job they expected me to provide for myself, and how they could somehow support my brother and not me. The arguments ended with them telling me to leave, and I ended up doing so. I've been living in my friends bedroom since then. that was a little over two months now. ive been working two jobs and my friend and their mom are gracious enough and in a comfortable financial position to be able to support me staying here, and ive never felt as bad as this in my life. Im three weeks away from moving into my own one bedroom apartment, and ive never wanted to die as much as I do in this very moment. Is there something I did for these things to have happened to me? Did I fuck up somewhere along the way and do something so irredeemable that I deserved this? I dont underatsnd. I never wanted this. why would they all do that to me? I dont understand. I wish I could just know how God decides these things. Im sure hes kind. Im sure someday ill be able to experience his kindness. I just want things to be better and this shitty summary probably wont do anything. how do you guys convince yourself to keep living when being alive hasn't been very kind to you? im not going to kill myself at all. I want to just hear that maybe I should keep trying. and that hoping can get me somewhere other than here. ",

    "selftext": "I (26M) want to kill myself. \n\nIdk where to start so here’s a brain dump. I live alone with my dog and cat, two part time jobs working 60 hours a week and I’m pretty financially stable. I get free food from working as I work in restaurants, I have a house, and I’m doing considerably well in comparison to those in worse living conditions. \n\nI also went through a divorce that I caused as I physically assaulted her. And as much as I can start to change: reading books on the abusive mindset and domestic violence, going to a Batterer’s Intervention Program, and actively take steps to rewrite my brain functioning, I can’t change the past and not inflict the lifelong trauma I have inflicted on the person I love the most. I suppose that’s the crux of it, this person was a huge part of my life and I drove it away. My ex-wife and their partner have forgiven me, but the guilt and shame still hang over me. \n\nI don’t really have any family, I have no notion of building one, and the one I have are just completely ignorant and don’t understand how I was the one that caused it (unfortunately my family thinks my wife was the one that caused my abuse 🙄), and don’t have any nuance to their thought. The chosen family I had with my wife and friends I destroyed any notion of too. In any case, talking with my family doesn’t help and they don’t seem keen on actually hearing me out. Also talking with them about suicide is just them invalidating everything I say so I don’t really know what to do with them. \n\nI have a talk therapist who I’ve been going to for a year, and a psychiatrist. The sessions are great but my motivation for living only lasts the whole day, and antidepressants will only keep me alive for so long. I’m on Effexor at the maximum dosage so it’s not like that’s helping. \n\nMy house is completely filthy, and although I’ve made some progress to clean it enough so no one will be affected by it, I can only see it getting worse before it gets better. \n\nFinally, I just don’t have the will to live. I was forced to live in this world, a world where late-stage capitalism is rampant so you’re forced to overwork yourself in order to live, genocide is being desensitized, and there is no escape besides death. Everything in life feels abstracted and numb, nothing feels real anymore. \n\nWriting this feels helpless too, I don’t know if I’m making any sense at all. I think the best thing that I could do is rehome my dog and cat and either live in a psych ward or commit suicide ✌️\n\nNever really posted before so I guess this truly is a cry for help",

    "selftext": "Anytime someone says they’re depressed the immediate reaction is “seek help!” which is not only dismissive, but also completely unhelpful.\n\nIf you’re suicidal, you can’t express it without being hospitalized, even if the thoughts are not active and a plan is not made, (at least in my experience, here in Florida they don’t hesitate), hospitalization made me a million times worse, being forced to talk about my feelings and having absolutely no stimulation were living nightmares, especially because I have adhd which makes boredom feel like torture, (they didn’t give me my meds in there because “there was nothing to focus on”) and since my body was used to taking them everyday, I couldn’t sleep for practically a week getting out, making my depression spiral. If your depression is due to your life situation like having no friends or dealing with toxic parents who you’re forced to stay with due to being a minor and no physical abuse occurring, therapy and other solutions likely won’t even help.\n\nAlso, if you talk to anyone outside of a therapist about your thoughts or if you self harm you’re “attention seeking”, yet I see those same type of people reposting things stating “check on your friends”, after you’ve been depressed for a while everyone gets tired of it, so you’re basically forced to suffer in silence. Even if you’re someone like me who’s extremely emotionally unavailable, gets angry when expected to open up, and starts to resent people who constantly monitor you, if you let even the smallest amount of depression slip suddenly you’re faking. \n\nNo matter how many suicides occur, people will still expect people with depression to just snap out of it and see it as us being a little sad, ignorance truly is bliss. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I’ve never read anything in this thread so my apologies in advance if you get BS like this every day here. \n\nI (31M) have dealt with depression since sophomore year of college at age 20. That was the first time I had cut myself at least. This has gone on and off for the past 11 years even 2/3 years without any cutting or suicidal thoughts at a time. The last time I cut myself was probably 4/5 months ago. I think I am done with that for good because it doesn’t do anything other than give me scars to be embarrassed about. Wish I had learned that lesson sooner. Out of college I did recruiting in NYC and had 5 years where I made over 200k. Felt on top of the world but empty at the same time. Lots of meaningless hookups and cocaine and alcohol and weed as well. I even experimented with GHB, Molly,K, LSD, shrooms, rlly any drug that could make me feel alive or take the edge off idk. \n\nI tried starting my own business to get away from that life, moved out of the city, cleaned up my act, and even saw some success/good times. A few bad breaks and that business is not exactly killing it so I turned it to a side hustle and picked up another job in sales that I can do from 9-5 and then work on my other business on the side. This year I will be lucky to make 100K.  \n\nQuite frankly I think I’m too much of a pussy to kill myself, but suicide becomes more logical to me every day. I’m miserable and unfulfilled in my life - and overall just feel like a shitty person. The worst part is that I have a GF of almost two years that wants to marry me and thinks I’m the most amazing boy in the world, when I very well know the opposite to be true. I have a great family as well. On paper I should be happy. But I’m just not happy at all.  \n\n\nFor anyone that has been in a similar situation, how did you get out of it?  What can I do to find purpose in my life and be happy?  I’m equally as miserable being poor as I was being rich so obviously success in my career is not the answer. I have also successfully completed dry months (2 this year alone) and that is not making a difference either. Maybe I’m just fucked ",

Everything is so stressful, i started to get gray hair already because of it. Depression messed with my brain and i forgot things so easy and fast. The only joy i get is masturbating and watching Youtube. I lay in bed all the time. My Parents call me lazy and i am a shame of son.\nI can't do anything. When i need to start something, i got so much anxiety to make things wrong that i push these thoughts away with Video games, Codein or just crying. \nI am so worthless and lonely its insane.\nBut my biggest problem yet: In my country (Germany) you have to do a final practical exam if you learned a job and i had about 3 months time to write an Word document what i want to do. I did nothing. Its the second time i fail and now i will fail my job exam. Everytime i wanted to start, there is this big mountain of \"failure\" and \"what if they are disappointed?\" and i immediatly break down and try to forget the work. I know it was much time but just couldnt do it. I told my parents before i started a job that i needed a break atleast a year. (to try to recover myself and \"repair\") But they only say \"they set me on the streets\" and \"i am not worth to be their son\" and \"who wants someone who doesnt work\" \nIt hurts me bad and so i decided to find anything and now i am here and broken. It feel like my storage in my head is full. I told them i need a break but they didnt listen. I wanna move out to clear my head but i dont know thats not what a good son does? And what should others think of me? A failure? A lazy Idiot? \nI dont know how long i can take this anymore.

I don't mean trivial things like dates, but for the last two months I've had multiple panic attacks, because (usually at night) he sends me text cancelling literally everything - us living together, him going to the doctor (after he panicked about dying for a week), going to uni -everything. After we talk for like four hours we usually settle on \"I'm going to kill myself in a few years anyway\" and that's it.\n\nI would get just saying no, I know this is common with depression, but here's the thing, like a day or two after this he's laughing about all the friends he's gonna make in uni and how happy he is to live with me next month. If he just cancelled it I'd underastand, but he doesn't just cancel it, he has big breakdowns over how he doesn't want to do anything and next day we're back to sunshine and rainbows.\n\nI feel as if I'm talking to two different people. He gets really mean and stuck on one thought for hours, asking me questions I can't possibly know the answer to (for example today he said he's too tired to ever do anything, but if he does nothing he'll kill himself and asked me what to do). It came to a point where I REALLY try not to mention any future related topics so he won't think about them and turn them upside down next evening. I'm really struggling. Careful planning for over a year, arrangements I've already made don't matter at all because he says so - if he doesn't want to do it, he won't. And theres no way of me talking him out of it when he \"switches\".\n\nSorry for the rant, my question is:\n\nIs this because of his depression or is it something else?\n\nI've never had depression, so I don't really know, but I feel like it should be more of a constant rather than this strange jumping from one thing to another. Also, if you happen to know how should I act in these situations, I'd appreciate the help. I have really bad anxiety, so right now I feel like I'm making it worse each time I say anything, so it's all over the place and not really if any help at all. Thanks in advance.",

These thoughts were destroying me from the inside, so I went to a psychotherapist. Since then, I have changed a lot. Many problems went away, and it seemed to me that the main reason why I wanted to hurt myself was gone. The problem was that I couldn't feel aggression. Like, at all. I could be angry only at myself. Yes, it sounds bad. Now I don’t understand how I lived like that. So, I thought that was it, but no. I am sliding back into the state I was in 5 years ago. It is getting worse every day, and I don’t know what to do at this point. I can’t make myself brush my teeth or shower, except on days when I need to go to work or study. The only thing I do is try to distract myself from thoughts of hurting myself, or worse, with games. I am still trying to overcome this state, but it is eating me up. I can't live and can't die either. There are many people in my life who would be destroyed if I did. I have done, and am doing, everything in my power to deal with this shit, but it is only getting worse, and I'm so tired at this point.",

They include moments I want to kill myself. I think those moments especially make this monthly transition scary.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month beginning is another reminder that I have made it past a time I promised myself I wouldn't. It's an unwanted obligation to live that I made just by not dying earlier. The 1st isn't a day I look forward to; it's a day I avoid because it reminds me that my body is mine and I have to live in it.\n\nIf I'm going to live, I'm going to have to deal with this monthly change twelve times a year until I die.

She’s stayed with me through a lot of difficult times, including when I dropped out of college. But lately I’ve been focusing on all of the bad in our relationship, and I can’t keep it to myself anymore.\n\nFirst off, I would reach out to a friend to talk about this shit, but I don’t have any friends. I used to have friends, but when I started dating my current girlfriend, guys nights had to include her. Any event I attended for the organizations I was a part of had to include her as well. I didn’t see the harm at first, including her in some aspects of my life.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, one of my best friends was killed in a motorcycle accident. My ex and this friend who was killed were in the same friend group in high school, and during that summer, my ex and I attended his funeral together and were able to let the past die; becoming friends again as if we had never dated in the first place. Personally, if it weren’t for my friend’s death, I would have never talked to my ex ever again. She had dumped me at a very low point in my life, but because of the shared tragedy, I was able to forgive her, and move on like an adult would.\n\nMy girlfriend, of course, had many reservations about the time I was spending with my ex, and no matter how many times I told her that there was no feelings of love or lust, she wouldn’t believe me. At the end of the summer, my ex invited me on a short road trip with our old friend group in memory of our friend who died.\n\nWe all splurged on a nice rental for the night, and at midnight, my girlfriend called me, asking when I would be back. When I told her I was staying the night because I was drinking, she flipped. In the end, she had me on the phone for over 3 hours, and I was sober enough to drive home and arrived at 6 in the morning. When pulled into my driveway, my girlfriend was there waiting for me. I had now been awake for 24 hours, and she divided that it was time for her ultimatum:\n\nShe created a set of “boundaries” for our relationship.\n\n1) that we wouldn’t associate with any prior partners\n2) we wouldn’t talk about any prior partners\n3) we would include each other in each others activities\n\nThe caveat, I am her FIRST romantic partner, so these boundaries are not applicable to her at all. They are controls.\n\nEvery month since then, my ex, who I will reiterate has no feelings towards me nor I for her, has always asked me to meet to do something that friends do. I don’t even know anymore. I don’t spend time with anybody now except my girlfriend.\n\nAnd every month, my girlfriend checks my texts, and yells at me for texting with this ex.\n\n3 years of this shit. My girlfriend says I’m on the way to being a better person, but in reality I feel like a caged animal.",

    "selftext": "Last year was very stable for me mentally — I felt good about myself in a way I hadn’t in a long time. But around February this year, the depression came back. At first I was still “functional,” managing to keep things going even though I wasn’t really okay. Then in April I went through a really heavy trauma, and that’s when things truly collapsed. With a few months of distance now, I can see how much I was already slipping before that.\n\nI also can’t stop thinking about how I wasted a huge part of this year because of a choice I made myself — accepting a dangerous job (a position at the public defender’s office inside a prison). Deep down I think I should’ve known it was going to destabilize me. Instead of focusing on what I needed, I walked straight into something that left me with trauma, knocked me off track with my studies, and even caused weight gain. It feels like I dug my own hole.\n\nI had been on Prozac before, and it worked pretty well in the past, but this time it just wasn’t enough — I was having daily suicidal thoughts and spending entire days doing nothing. So my doctor switched me to bupropion, and I’m now on day 26.\n\nSince then, I’ve managed to get back into daily exercise (which is essential for me to feel okay) and started studying again. Things are way better than before — when I first started the new med, I was at rock bottom, and now the worst my mind throws at me is something like that Tony Soprano line.\n\nI know I need to trust the process. Today was definitely a bad day, and I hope there will be better ones ahead. But right now the feeling of wanting to cry without knowing why just hurts. I keep wondering how other people handle",

    "selftext": "I feel like I just need to talk about my life.\nI became depressed in 2022, after breaking up from a childish toxic relationship with a boy who wanted to pull me away from all my friends. I loved him, but each time it became too much, I broke up with him, and immediately went back to him when I saw him at my school. I felt bad, when maybe I was the one being manipulated.\nHe was one year older, and I became so terrified of seeing him at my school that I wrote a 5 pages letter to my mom, explaining how I didn't wanted to go to school anymore, and how I wanted to die. A few days later, I had my first appointments, and I soon went to a day hospital, where you go from random activities, to some school, to psychological appointments. I stayed almost a year and a half there, when the average time was barely a few months.\nI stopped going to school. At first I went to just a few classes, and then I completely stopped. School is so terrifying to me that when my mom and I had to go to the school psy, I almost had a panick attack just thinking about going back in the building. Plus the entire appointment has been heard by students who listened through the door. One of the worst memories of my life.\nI also started taking pills around that same time.. but I never realized how much I needed them before today.\n\nIt's been around 2-3 months since I've stopped taking them, and for the past months, I've been having so many mental breakdowns and anger issues that I feel inhuman.\nI also recently went through a breakup with my ex-boyfriend who lives in another country, and I think it didn't helped.\n\nMy old phone broke around a week ago because of a dumb fall, and I had a very hard time going through it, especially because I entirely payed it myself, only two months ago.\nI have a new one now, the same model, that my mom payed. And just this morning, because of an anger impulsion, I broke 1/3 of my PC's screen. It was a PC a friend gave me because she didn't used it, and my old PC didn't supported any games anymore.\nI know I'm at fault, and I feel so bad right know. It still works, but almost half of the screen is black. I had to go take my phone outside right after I broke my pc's screen, and I can tell you I could've broke in tears in public at any moment. I felt so useless and guilty, and I still do right know.\n\nMy mom told me I needed to see my psy again, and I agree with it. I also probably need pills again, because I've never been this bad for a long time. I feel like I could end everything at any moment now. I've cried more tears today than in an entire week at the start of my depression.\n\nI feel so empty, and so full of bad thoughts at the same time. I'm not the girl I used to be before the vacations. I'm scaring myself sometimes.\nI just want to feel okay again. It was getting better, and I feel like I need to restart all over again now. I hate the feeling of being attached to pills, like it's the only thing holding me back from ending myself. It feels so wrong to be held back by a dumb pill.\n\nI feel so alone, even when I know I have ton of people supporting me each day. And I hate myself so much for putting my mom through my breakdown.\n\nI always tried to help other people who where struggling, because that's why I want to do. I always want to help others with the same problem that goes into my mind. I can't help myself, so I help others.\nI try to give the best advices, the ones that other told me when I was at my lowest. I always try to be there for them, even when I feel like a burden. Even when I want to end it.\n\nIs being happy impossible once you went through that? I often think that.\nI just wish I never came to life.\nIt's hard.",

When he joins, it is always pain and suffering.  \nI thought I can live with this, but recently he told me that he changed his mind about kids. We wanted to have them one day, but now he does not want anymore and that is a breaking point for me\n\nI know I am incredibly selfish and that he suffers way more that I can imagine. I would give my whole world for him to be healthy and that we can have a beautiful relationship with kids one day. I just can't take it anymore and I feel like after all those years I need to leave\n\nSo for those that did this - how did it go?

    "selftext": "28yo. I have been addicted to amphetamines for nine years now. Over the course of that time I cannot say I have been truly happy. Indeed, I have been through some very dark moments. Hospitalizations, overdose scares. After a particularly trying time four years ago I swore to myself I would use responsibly and not abuse it any more.\n\nSince then I had come to find a job I really and truly loved, the first time in my life I ever experienced something like that, and someone who came to be the love of my life. I continued to use during this period and I feel like, emotionally and spiritually, there was still a lot wrong with me. I was continuing to abuse drugs and engage in self destructive habits. Regardless though, I had this job and this one particular person there with me who made my life worth it. I did feel guilty about continuing to abuse drugs and engage in other habits while with them (the job and the person) but they were among the few bright spots of my life.\n\n11 days ago, I lost both of those things irreparably. I won't say exactly what happened or what I did, not yet at least, but, suffice to say, outside of doing something illegal, it could not have been more shameful or dishonorable. I resigned from my job for today and have come to face the fact I will never see the person I love again. The worst part?\n\nI have nobody to blame but myself.\n\nMy actions and some of the vile things I was doing came to the light....actions and things that stemmed from my drug addiction. I am fairly certain that, if I had not been using drugs, I would not have engaged in such things and this fallout would never have happened. These amphetamines truly turned me into a bad person.\n\nSo now, here I am again, with nothing. I had done so well at my job, and had acquired such a loved and trusted reputation...now I am leaving in dishonor and as a pariah. Even worse than that is that one person I cared so much about....now I know I will never see them again. Even the time I had with them was tainted by dishonesty, drugs usage and betrayal....it could have been so much better and THAT, perhaps just as much as never seeing them again, will always torment me.\n\nPeople will tell me to move on....people will talk about \"rock bottom\" and \"coming back up again.\" Could I? I don't know....perhaps. By right now, I feel as if I don't even want to. After what I have lost I don't even feel the attempt to try and get back anything ever again. A large part of me doesn't even want to; I feel like fully embracing self destruction and just fading away. I will never achiever again what I had before. For the first time in my life I am feeling genuinely suicidal.\n\nAnd NO, I am not throwing a pity party, I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I fully earned where I am at and feel as if in my position suicide is in fact the most natural and logical response to what I have done, what I have lost and what I have become. \"Permanent solution to a temporary problem\" but sometimes the problem is not temporary or is so much it permanently mars your future.\n\nWhere do I go from here? I have no idea...but I know I can never get back what I have lost, the two solid foundations I had.\n\nNeedless to say....I have been severely depressed since then and have actually been considering leaving permanently. People keep telling me to get a new job, things will get better...but this was a serious blow. ",

Before starting the medication, in terms of my depression, I was actually feeling good. I wasn’t numb and didn’t want to kill myself, I was talking to my friends often, and indulging in the things that typically bring me joy. Though, I was still getting quite anxious. \n\nI start taking the medication and after a week I enter a depressive state. I knew it was too soon for the medication to start effecting me so I’m considering it to be one of the usual episodes I get. The medication definitely lessens my anxiety, but it’s been a long time and I am still feeling depressed. This time around it does feel different. Though I’m not talking to my friends much, I still know the things that I need to do (feed myself, do my work for my classes, wake up at an appropriate time each morning) and I do them. And I know the things that I typically enjoy doing and I do them. But I don’t feel anything. I don’t want to die, but I still don’t want to be here living life. I’ve told my psychiatrist this and she increased my dosage to 50mg last week. My question is, is this what the meds are supposed to feel like? Will it improve with the dosage increase? I’m not sure if this is what SSRI’s are supposed to make me feel. I can’t imagine myself not feeling this way. I’m not happy, but unlike previously I’m still able to function. It feels like the meds are just dragging me throughout life on a chain and I’m indifferent to it all. ",

In December I hurt my foot and after going to urgent care, my primary care, and Ortho they finally did an MRI in April and found out it was fractured so they put me on a knee scooter for 5 weeks which messed up my back and I just lived with it out of fear of being called dramatic until the end of July when I couldn't take it anymore made an appointment with my primary care. We have done X-rays, MRI, CT Scan and all kinds of crap to find the problem with my back with no real answers. The last week and a half has been the absolute worst. It started with back pain so bad I went to urgent care where they gave me a shot of toradol and muscle relaxers. I had a bad reaction to the toradol causing even more pain to the point I could barely walk. Then a couple of days later I started having what was diagnosed as muscle spasms so bad I thought I had kidney stones, I started taking the muscle relaxers. Then I had a bad reaction to the muscle relaxers causing my foot to swell up and become so painful it was hard to walk. I finally got that taken care of and now my knee/leg is so messed up I can't walk right. I have been to both urgent care and the ER and was told I'm not welcome back because they think I'm just after drugs but I have never once done drugs in my life and didn't ask for anything other than answers. Now I am stuck at home (I live alone), none of my so-called friends will talk to me anymore because they all think I'm being dramatic and I can't possibly hurt this bad, my step mom and my mom are just tired of me \"complaining\" about hurting.

    "selftext": "I'm a 20 year old college student and currently live with my dad and sister. Me and my dad don't have the best relationship as we constantly get into arguments. He fails to understand me and I keep letting him down because of his expectations of him wanting me to be someone he wants me to be. Not too go much into it, but I owe around $2k to him to pay back. I'm currently doing doordash to pay it off as of now and I have a moving company job lined up soon. However even with all this, he refuses to let me play the drums, which is the only source of happiness I have gotten in years, as well as restricting me from seeing any of my friends, in which I barely have as of now.\n\n  \nTo cope with this, I have been secretly smoking cigarettes while I work, which is something that he hates and has caught me multiple times doing so, as recent as today. He ended up throwing them out and stormed off. While I didn't know how to react with any emotion at this point, it lead me to think of harming myself with a kitchen knife. I've done this before in the past and have tried to stay off from doing it again for a few months, but this thought has come into my head stronger than before. I don't want to get mad or lash out on anyone around me, including my dad, so I resort to doing that. This is the accumulation of the many arguments we've had in the past month of August and a little before that. He's verbally abused me and has even hit me in the chest as recently as last week, when he caught me with cigarettes before. I genuinely can't take it anymore and it's wearing me down. With the new job and school semester coming up and even knowing I'm probably gonna get everything back in the next month or two, it's still too much and I'm not even looking forward to it anymore. It's gotten to the point where my self harm thoughts are slowly turning into suicidal thoughts, and my mind seems to ease into that thought without worry. I feel like I've let not only the people around me down, but also myself.\n\n  \nI don't know what to do anymore and I'm lost. Is there a better solution to all of this or steps that I can take to not have to have these thoughts and carry out on harming myself anymore?",

Things can always get worse, but I don’t want to find out what’s worse than this. This might be the best and worst option simultaneously. My will used to be stronger I was ready to do it rationally, now it feels like I’m not in control anymore.\n\nEndlessly Torturing Myself:\n\nIt’s that same song again, the one I imagine playing at my funeral.  \nA funeral I’m late to everyday.    \nLying in bed,    \nI wait for someone to notice the dead body and have it removed.    \nBut no one does because I’m not good enough to be dead yet.    \nI still breathe and bleed.    \nI’m still here, like a ghost stuck in a body.    \nSometimes I wonder if I possessed this body because my soul was going to hell. That instead I’d rather torture myself and create my own hell.    \nThe truth is what I desire the most is to never have existed.    \nHow can one end their own existence when hell is eternal?    \nHow is it possible to end my existence without my hatred, could I truly die if I stopped hating myself?    \nNo one’s bothered to kill me, I’m alone.    \nEither they hate me so much they’d also rather me torture myself endlessly or they just don’t care.    \nI don’t deserve my suffering to end.    \nI’m not even worth being killed, out of love or hate, what would someone get out of it?    \nI deserve to suffer, and no one wants to end it besides the one part of me that loves or even cares about myself.    \nBut my love could never amount to the hatred I bear.    \nMaybe if someone loved me enough, they could end my existence.    \nDoes God love me?    \nI don’t know if I ever believed in God, and if I did it was for all the wrong reasons.    \nI prayed to God, begged he could end me, but I also begged demons who revealed their names in my dreams.    \nI’m evil.    \nI’m a selfish person, wishing for love to kill me.    \nWishing for a love that doesn’t exist and resenting everyone for it.    \nIt just makes me hate myself more.    \nWill I ever love myself enough to k**l myself?    \nWill I ever accept the suffering I would put others through?    \nI don't know.    \nWhat’s left of me, what even am I?    \nIt feels like I must be a demon devouring itself.    \nA demon that can’t love itself any other way.    \nMaybe what makes hell is love.    \nThis is hell’s love and hate.  \nIt doesn’t end, because love is endless just as hate is.    \nThat is torture.    \nAm I a ghost in a shell or the shell of a demon?    \nI degrade as the song replays over and over again,    \nuntil I cannot be recognized as anything but the shell encasing hell itself.",

It feels like my life isn’t getting any better.. like I’m failing in life as I watch my friends and family enjoy their life..on social media. I’ve tried to stay off of social media as much as possible but that’s all I have at the moment. I have a mother and a little sister. Which makes me no better. I don’t have the kind of mother that would just hug me when I’m feeling down or just listen to me. I have the kind of person who “motivates” or criticize me for feeling depressed, for bringing down the energy, for not being more of a “daughter” that she wished she had. \n\n_________________________________________\n\nWhen I feel like I’m drowning in debt. We’ve recently moved to a new state and we can’t afford the rent, the plan beforehand was me getting an job and helping out which was going great until I got terminated after 2 weeks of working and now it’s almost a month and I can’t find a job. I’ve applied to 150ish applications… I don’t know personally, what more I can do. I’ve used both of my credit card to help out with the moving.. which put me over my limit. I am overdraft on my bank account and only have 15 days to pay it, I have debt on my chime, I have to pay the Affirm account, my mother put in my name, I have to pay half of the rent which is $500.. when I never got paid from my last job.. and it’s almost been 3 weeks. I have to start college in 2 days and I don’t have a car, which means I need to take a Uber  or Lyft. Which I can’t afford to do. \n\n_________________________________________\n\nI have to pay my Apple Account because I can’t download anything, I feel bad even getting my hair done… just for school. I feel like a fucking loser.. and it’s making me hate living.. hate god, to hate everyone and everything. I want to take out a loan, but I don’t even have good credit anymore, my credit went from a 700 to 500, I’m the only person paying off my stuff.. and my mother is constantly signing me up for jobs, constantly telling me what I need to, what needs to be done like I’m not already stressed over it. I understand. Yes. I know, my responsibility but it’s like I’m slowly forgetting and losing my passion for the things I wanted to do because of the responsibilities and when I’m sad and hurting on inside , all she do is remind me or criticize my behaviors, my attitude, my hurt, and the fact that I’m a grown up..like I forgotten that simple fact. I didn’t even get to do anything for my own birthday, simply because I didn’t have any money and I was terminated a day beforehand. \n\n_________________________________________\n\nAll she does is close the door, when I’m feeling down or hurt.. when I cry.. I have to sleep In The living room because the place my mother got .. can only fit two people.. two bedrooms.. and an extra stress factor is that I can’t tell anyone or talk to anyone.. because she’s saying I’m talking about her or continuing try to kick me out. Some days, I have to spend hours outside because she doesn’t like the way I speak or I start to defend myself against her insults… and all she can do is tell me to hurry up and get my own place because she can’t stand it.. when she knows my situation.. she can see it.. and she’ll say it’s all excuses.. when I don’t know what to do. God won’t help me, I can’t get a job, and time just keeps flowing.. I seriously just want to die. It’s so hard . ",

My oldest is special needs—autism, Tourette’s, bipolar, ADHD—and became extremely violent toward me during COVID as puberty hit. For 3–4 years, I endured broken windows, stabbing, attacks while driving, threats to kill me, being chased with sharp objects, punched, bitten, and clawed. Police were called dozens of times, and he’s been in multiple facilities, one for over 500 days. As his violence escalated, our marriage fell apart. My wife distanced herself and I had no family nearby.\n\nI coped by heavy cannabis and psychedelic use, which began as relief but spiraled into extreme dissociation. I was also diagnosed ADHD and bipolar and PTSD. In my delusion and pain, I made the irreversible mistake of cheating on my wife—something I’ll never forgive myself for. I’m devastated, consumed by regret, and plagued daily by suicidal thoughts. I even attempted once but couldn’t go through with it. I spent time in a mental institution, started new meds, and racked up a large bill.\n\nI’ve been sober since March, fully aware of the pain I’ve caused. I’m losing the home we’ve had for 6 years—it’s been on the market for months without selling despite price drops. I moved to a new place when I had money, but now can’t afford rent while still paying the mortgage. The divorce left me so distraught I lost both jobs in May. I’ve repented, turned back to God, and cling to scripture, but the pain never leaves. I feel disgusted with myself and struggle to find motivation. I try to be a good dad, but the darkness always pulls me back.\n\nShe’s moved on with a new boyfriend. I love my boys deeply and know my death would devastate them, yet I often feel I can’t go on. Friends nearby don’t know how to help, and I’m mostly alone. Therapy hasn’t helped much. I’m haunted by vivid dreams of her, only to wake to this nightmare. I can’t believe what I’ve done to my family, and the pain never leaves.\n\nPlease pray for me.",

    "title": "why do parents force their kids to go to church?",
    "selftext": "Long story short I’m being forced to church, iv had horrible bonds with religion all together, It was hell, started in foster \tcare when I was 5-7, I think I was still in diapers according to my dad. I lost all faith in religion the moment I was told my mom chose drugs over me, I used to ask myself why god never listened to my prayers whenever I prayed to him, why whenever I needed him he wasn’t there, silent. I remember when I was 10 I used to tell my siblings “god isn’t real, he’s just a make up story” and we’d all get into arguments about it, then my dad would hear about it, and I’d be yelled at for saying such things. Whenever I got my butt whooped or whenever I felt like I wanted to end things i used to ask someone why god never listened to me, and they’d say “it’s all gods plan for your great future” *now that I’m thinking about it, it sounds like something my grandma would say* and I’d just feel defeated, I always sat near my window and closed my eyes to think about why me wanting to kill myself and why me cutting was apart of my grand future, I was such a confused little child, it’s funny to think about now, I’d literally sit at my window for almost 2 hours a day , sitting on my knees, hands locked in, praying for some sign that he was real, that he was watching me. Never got an answer, and every time I never got that answer I chopped it up as god being busy helping people who really needed him at the moment, to busy to answer my plea.\n\nFast forward yatta yatta blah couple years ago, I made the decision to be an atheist, those years of constant unanswered prayers, unfair treatment and depression really snuffed my beliefs, I started diving into it, looking into why people believed so hard, why people put their whole faith in someone who was never actually there. A little school science and internet scanning later, I found out it was just that, a belief, not an actual fact or something real, just a belief. When I tell you I was so upset that day, I still remember just digging my fingernails down my cheeks in dismay, I remember hoping that god was real, that I was mistaken, but nah, just a belief. Since then, iv been seeing life as something I have no control over anymore, well, I think it’s just my dissociation talking. More like, I’m living the life without that belief, and it’s terrifying, in a way, but also, iv never felt so..free I guess. No more stepping on eggshells believing I was sinning whenever I did an action, no more frets about if I repented or if I had added onto my list of mistakes, no more fear of the day god would come back, ring his trumpets and judge me, because none of that is actually REAL, it’s just a belief, just a guess. It’s like, assuming something. But now that iv come to that conclusion, I can’t see church as I used to anymore, I see it as more of a gathering to come together to enjoy that one belief with others, until the part where they start talking about the day of judgement and the trumpets and the atoning and then they all start shouting and swaying and hollering. It gets uncomfortable, really uncomfortable, because when I’m in church, it no longer feels like a normal gathering, it doesn’t feel peaceful, it feels cramped and lacking oxygen, it’s like once I go in, my chest hurts I’m not able to sit still, sometimes I feel like I’ll barf. And that feeling stays till I leave. When I was told I had no choice in going to church or just staying home I lost it, I felt betrayed by my dad’s girlfriend, she seemed so nice, understanding. \n\nBut, as usual, I should have never trusted her, I should have never trusted anybody, this is what happens when I do trust people, I’m let down and forced into stuff, I get no choice in what I want. I hate parents, thinking they’re above their kids because they’re older, fuck off. Anyways, sad to see my progress dissipated but I get to do my old habits again, truth be told, I like the way the scars look when they heal, it’s like looking into a new layer of myself, wonderful. Oh, before I go, Iv lost all my respect for my dads girlfriend, If im forced to do stuff then so be it, but I won’t listen to anything she says to me from now on, since I don’t get a say in my life, she doesn’t ether.\n\nSmell you later lozerssssass😼",

    "title": "18 M suffering from depression and I don't know what to do",
    "selftext": "18 M. Sorry for this being so long, but this is my last cry before I just give up on asking for help, so I wanted to be detailed.\n\nWhat exactly is the point of everything? I've been depressed for the past 5 years, and my life has completely stagnated. I'm not sure what to do or how to even move on.\n\nIt all started around the age of 13, when I began suffering from multiple physical health issues. Due to medical neglect from my anti-medicine family, my conditions only worsened and lasted years. Any time I'd try to ask my family to take me to a doctor for treatment, they'd yell at me and emotionally manipulate me into feeling bad for even asking the question. This led to my relationship with my family completely falling off. I still barely talk to my parents, even though I live with them. I'm too afraid to talk to them.\n\nWhile my health issues were ongoing, I also had a falling out with my only two friends I had known since I was a young kid. I've always been a \"weird\" kid, in the sense that I like nerdy stuff no one else cared for. That's why I initially clicked with these two people. But around the age of 13, it feels like they suddenly switched personalities, and they started making fun of me for enjoying certain games, music, etc. It got so bad they started calling me slurs and refused to talk to me, all the while I never said a single thing to them to provoke this.\n\nNow it's been 5 years since all that happened. And even though my health issues are better, I'm left with this existential dread. I have no idea what I'm doing or where I'm going. For further context, I live in rural America. I don't have a driver's license, and to walk anywhere, it'd require me to walk for at least an hour. I was homeschooled as well. Because of all these factors, I never had social interaction. The only social interaction I had came from my only two friends and my family. My friends made me feel bad simply for being passionate about certain things. Even though I have moved on from my friends bullying me, and I hold no grudges towards them today, I still subconsciously suffer from the effects of that situation. And I also was completely shut down by my parents, and they made me feel stupid and lesser compared to them solely for needing their help. Because of this, I have social anxiety to the largest degree. Literally someone saying \"hello\" to me makes me freeze for a moment. I know I wasn't in the wrong in the situation with my friends or my family, but my brain is trying to protect itself from ever experiencing pain like that again by preventing me from talking to anyone. It's like a trauma response.\n\nI had one other friend besides the two I mentioned, but that relationship completely fell apart because of me, because I couldn't open up due to my social anxiety making me fearful of talking. Anytime I go out in public now, I try to make myself as invisible as possible. I'd rather people not even notice me. I suppose you could call it dissociation or derealization. I have no friends, I've never even felt love. I so desperately want connection, but I'm afraid to talk to people, afraid to have them hate me.\n\nI'm not sure how to make friends. I don't even know where to begin. I'm working on getting my driver's license now, which will open up more possibilities for me, but it won't make a difference if I'm incapable of even talking to people. \n\nNow my family is expecting me to get a job immediately once I get my driver's license, which is of course essential and I don't want to come off as lazy or avoiding work. But I feel like I missed out on all my formative teen years. Anytime I hear people talk about their stories of their childhood/teenage friends, or how those were the most \"important\" and \"best\" days of their lives, it makes me depressed, because I never had that experience and never will. I'm not ready for adulthood, when I wasn't even able to experience my teen years. That whole period from the age of 13-18 feels like a blur to me. Time moved in the blink of an eye, and I can barely remember anything important that happened in my life during that period. It's all so bleak and I don't even see what the point is. I don't want to commit suicide, but I've certainly thought about it. But I'm afraid of hurting my family, and I also don't want to cut my life short before it can truly begin, if that ever happens.\n\nSomething that hurts really bad is that I don't even feel emotion anymore. I don't think I've cried once this entire year. I used to cry nearly every night about all these things, but now they just make me feel nothing other than a pain in my chest. No matter how hard I try, I just can't cry. I care for people deeply, but even when I hear incredibly sad news unrelated to my own life, I just feel nothing. It all just feels so meaningless and I don't know how to change that. I've become desensitized to sadness. I want to cry and I'm tired of bottling it up, but I just can't.\n\nThe only things I have going for me left in my life is my hobbies. But I've become so fixated on perfectionism with my hobbies, to the point that I barely even want to do them anymore because I feel like I'm not any good at them. If there's even a tiny imperfection in my creative work, I will hate myself for it. I don't want to self-diagnose, but I'm afraid I could have OCD based on my symptoms. Of course, I'd love to get my mental health evaluated by a professional, but I can't with my current living situation. And, my own mental state makes me feel so tired and broken all the time that I can hardly focus on my passions.\n\nHere's a TLDR: I had health issues and was neglected by my family, my only friends bullied me for my hobbies, I developed social anxiety and because of that I abandoned the only real friend I've ever had, I live in the middle of nowhere and can't go anywhere, I have no friends and have never experienced love, I barely enjoy hobbies anymore due to my own perfectionism, I've lost the ability to cry, my family expects me to get a job soon but I don't feel like I'm prepared since I never got to experience my teen years, and I've been depressed for 5 years straight and am having suicidal thoughts (but won't act on them, so don't worry). Thanks for reading, I appreciate you and hope you're doing okay. <3\n",

I’ve tried bettering myself — working out, eating better, trying to be more confident and for a little while, I’d feel good. I’d feel like maybe I could change things. But then, like always, it fades, and I’m right back to sitting in my room alone, doom scrolling, watching everyone else’s life look better than mine, wondering why I’m even here.\n\nI’ve thought about killing myself too many times.

Like you don’t want to be dead — you just don’t want to feel like this anymore.\n\nBut I’ve come to realize something. Nothing gets better unless we make it better. And that’s the hardest part. Because we’re already tired, drained, done. But no one’s coming to save us. No magical moment is gonna flip our life around. It’s us or nothing.\n\nAnd here’s something that keeps me here when it gets too dark: I think about the people who’ve been through worse people who were raped, beaten, neglected by everyone they ever loved and they’re still fighting, still breathing, still pushing through. If they can keep going, then who am I to give up? I owe it to them to people who’ve seen worse and still chose to live to try too.

(And this was the only question that I have responded in positive)\n\nI had a breakup very recently, don't know what is going in life, no real friends, no social interaction, life pressure, etc etc (I know these are common in everyone's life, but I need experts to help me sort it out)\n\nAs I am a student, let's first talk about student's life.\n\nStudent pressure -  \nI am an above average student. (Yes, high expectations from everyone. Even I and my own parents have very high expectations from me)... Now I am (very) desperate to have friends and talk with people... But it just don't seem right.. Everyone is very busy in their studies, and it's true, why will they even talk with me when they have such load?  \nI have wasted my whole 1.6 years by this, now I have backlogs which have to be completed in 3 months (2 years work in 3 months)... But, with all these pressures, I don't know I am just desperate to talk to someone who can understand me and help me. I spend my time scrolling through reddit, shorts, WhatsApp - just looking for someone to communicate on any topic.\n\nLife pressure -  \nMy parents have spent their whole life savings on my studies (I am from lower middle class family)... I am given all the facilities to study. As they have spent their whole life savings on my studies and have taken a huge loan, they want me to study all the time (study, eat, sleep, repeat) and they aren't wrong. I am from India, here the competition is very very competitive and I have wasted (and is wasting) all my time. Now, as my father have scrap business, his business is slowly dying too. So, I will have to be a sole earner in my house that can support my entire family. (Statistically, it's only possible when I am from the very top college in my country). My parents and I does not even have any insurance, vehicle, nothing, we don't even travel, no saving account etc. My father works from 8 am to 10pm. My mother, who is housewife, always tell me to study - she don't want me to spend my entire lifetime just like them (i.e, having no leisure and safety)\n\nMental pressure -  \nEveryone have very very high hopes from me. Not only this, the big question is - won't I be able to break the loop of this poverty? Won't I be able to travel with my whole family? What will happen when my father will suddenly diagnosed with any critical illness disease? The whole family will break and we will literally come on roads. My parents have not enjoyed their single life, they are turning old, as a son of theirs, don't I have duty (rather dharma) to fulfill all their dreams and provide them with the best healthcare possible? (I hate being poor, I lost my grandfather and maternal grandmother because of this reason, I don't want this to repeat, I don't want my parents to die without having any enjoyment)\n\nLove life pressure -  \nIn my old school, it was mandatory for one boy to sit beside a girl. So, there was no sex discrimination. We used to think that both of them are equal.  \nIn my new school, it is mandatory for girls and boys to sit in two different columns, and when someone just says hi to any girl. The whole class (yes, even teachers) thinks themselves as couple. Moreover, in my school, regional language is used and I only know hindi and english - so it's difficult for me to communicate as well... (and obviously almost all of the people prefer their own culture over others...)  \nLet's say I made it to any best university in India. The problem again is - Ratio is 10:1... So.. you know.  \nNow, as in online social medias and movies I see, I see that boy and girl (strangers) approach each other, asks to swap numbers and start talking. Here, it's not feasible at all. I don't judge a person based on looks and how can I even know if she is good or not, without being friends atleast for a week?  \n(And the reason of previous breakup was - miscommunication. She was my first friend and... )  \nJust as boys, girls also judge boys (initially) on beauty and finance (not directly, but dates, gifts, etc)... (Yeah, because they do not have any parameters to judge because of the great partition created by my society)... And I am an average looking skinny boy, I master in making someone smile and happy for long period of duration (This is only possible, when I start talking to someone, which is not being feasible here and I am an introvert)\n\nHelp required for -\n\n1. How to do something without expecting anything in return?\n2. How to make your life very interesting and enjoyable being alone?\n3.

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI’m posting here because I have to get this off my chest, and I have no one else to talk to.\n\nGrowing up, I thought I had a perfect life—kind, hardworking parents, two younger brothers. But when I hit 5th grade, everything changed. My friends bullied me about being “poor,” and it led me down a path of stealing money from home just to fit in. My parents found out and punished me hard. I stopped, but in 9th grade, the bullying got worse, and I ended up making a series of mistakes including taking adult magazines and my dad’s old phone (with adult content) to school. One of my friends ratted me out, and I was humiliated publicly, especially bad since my mom was a teacher at my school.\n\nThings spiraled. I self-harmed after a teacher screamed at me. My mom took me to a psychiatrist — who prescribed heavy meds (quetiapine 1000mg daily), possibly after being misled by my mom. I was taken out of school, isolated, medicated for years—and found out much later my mom had been in an affair.\n\nEven after finishing my 10th and 12th externally, when I went to college, my family was falling apart. My mom left my dad, accused him falsely, and cut me, my brothers, and my dad off. She even involved me in helping her shift out. Later, my mom and her “friend” visited me, and I discovered she wanted w\\*\\*d—for her lover.\n\nWhen I tried to confront her and say I’d stop the divorce, she called someone and arranged for me to be *kidnapped*. I was taken, drugged, beaten, and kept in a “rehab” center for months. I later learned my own mother had paid for them to do this to me. I was only fed rice water and onion for months. My dad found out I was missing and pressured my mom until I was released.\n\nNot long after, I tried to speak to my dad about all this, it turned into a fight, I cut my hand badly enough to need surgery. That’s when I was diagnosed with blood cancer (CML).\n\nNow, I’m only in my twenties, I’ve got 10 lakhs in debt, lost money to toxic relationships, and the only hope I have left is my wife, Komal. We’re an inter-caste couple—her family hates me, my dad barely supports us, and my wife sometimes seems distant too. I feel like dying every single day, like I have no love left in my life.\n\nI started an initiative, Aidn Health, to help others with health and mental illness, but had to shut it down for lack of support. I don’t want to die invisible or unloved. I just want someone to understand, to know there’s still some good left in me, even after all I survived.\n\nIf you read this far, thank you. Please, tell me how to keep going, or at least that I’m not alone.",

I don’t know when it necessarily started but the depression really hit me when I was in 9th grade. I became very suicidal and I started self harm (Sh). It was a coping mechanism for me and it still is to this day, I am now in 11th grade. The school year ended and I was very sad because I won’t ever see my counselor again since she left the school and since I am moving schools because I got kicked out because of my mental health. They did not want to accept me anymore since I was a problem apparently. Really broke my heart I cried for 5 days nonstop and was debating weather I should overdose (Od). I’ve been sh clean for a month and a half now and I am debating weather I should relapse because I want to feel something. I just want all my traumas and pain to go away. I used to be abused by my dad verbally emotionally mentally and sometimes physically. I still love him but I can’t fully forgive him for all the pain he caused me and still causes me to this day. I just want to find someone who has a similar story because none of my friends seem to believe me. I find out that they have shit talked me and have been saying that I fake all the things I have been saying for attention. That really made me lose trust since I really trusted them with a sensitive topic to find out that they don’t believe me. I go to therapy but I haven’t seen my therapist in almost a month. I am debating to call her to tell her I am having suicidal thoughts and sh thoughts again and that I am close to ending it. I haven’t told anyone how I am feeling in over a month because I have no one to tell, my friend will either shit talk me or gossip about my problems, and if I tell my parents they will just tell me “don’t worry”, my therapist won’t do much either. I don’t know what to do anymore. Suicide is a sin in my religion but I don’t wanna live anymore. I’m stuck in between wanting to live and wanting to die. I have also been researching my mood swings, suicidal thoughts, self harm behaviors, depressive episodes, unstable relationships, fear of abandonment, the chronic feeling of emptiness and I found out that those symptoms are actually symptoms of BPD or bipolar. I don’t want to self diagnosis because I am not that type of person and I have tried hinting to my therapist about these symptoms but she just doesn’t do anything and I just want to know what’s wrong with me. Why and I like this what and I, who am I. I just want peace and I just want to die because I genuinely can’t do this anymore. Thank you for reading this. ",

Am I suffocating my partner? Someone help me, I feel so broken, lost, and alone \n",

    "selftext": "(1st born only son) I'm a 33 white male who has been moving around since he was just a child. I could never hold a friendship because my parents would fight for custody and on top of that I had a horrible speech impediment. I was 5 or so and my parents instead of taking to the hospital when I had my 1st asthma attack they threw me in a hot shower so I could \"breath\" I lost 80% of my breathing and was rushed to the hospital which I was admitted for weeks. Not having oxygen to the brain cause slight brain damage. Then when I lived with my father after there separation of my dad being a drunk and my mother being a whore. I was being drivin home from school and my dad let me sit in the front. We get to a accident where I slam my head against the window leaving a huge crack. The only thing I remember that day was I was in the Walmart parking lot after gaining consciousness and my dad asking if I were ok. I proceeded to nod being a child and all the we went home. No hospital nothing. Now my frontal lobe has a slight arch towards it. No one has this in my family. Then speed up to 1st grade and all I remember is we're having a pizza party and we're watching the old Mario live action show. I then go to the back area where they kept our back packs and I can't remember why but all that stays with me is a girl who was the teachers assistant s.a me in the back while everyone was watching a movie. Then proceed to 3rd grade. I have symptoms of IBS on top of horrible horrible anxiety. So bad I'd start shaking and loosing my bowls and going to the bathroom in my pants. On top of my mother who never really cooked unless it was in a microwave. My diet wasn't parent friendly it was w.e was easier for her on her time. Knowing I had anxiety and IBS my mother couldn't deal with it as she had my younger sisters only 1 year apart from each other. That had ADHD. So they lived like zombies. Instead of helping my to see a doctor or a therapist she threw full blown diapers on me .. diapers .. in 3rd grade. Then 4th grade turned around and I started living with my father and his bf ( ya he ended up being gay after my mother left him. And she despised him for it. I didn't care to be far he was my dad as long as I got to see him at the time cuz it was 1 every 3 months if that) 4th grade I started a new school.. again.. my father was very strict with food and was pissed about the diaper situation. But he'd forced feed me corn knowing I hated it (ya I'ma kid I'ma hate vegetables..) but shoving down your throat.. till you throw up. Then thrown in your room to cry and have the rest of the corn for breakfast.. a bit much. The IBS this wasn't fun either. We'd do a enema almost every week. A long tube in my ass while my father squeezed the hot water to get all the shit out. Not Knowing I'm still shitting my pants only cuz of horrible anxiety and being anxious and nervous about situations. Then as a kid I stopped doing my homework. My life was just being controlled and I've fallen in depression. I didn't have any friends and I kept my self distance cuz I moved so much. On top my dad didn't want ppl knowing that he had a bf even tho they ran a movie/comic store together. So I wasn't allowed to have any friends over. I was home mostly by myself. The. My father found out I was doing my he and took me home. I told him I did my he I just forgot it . Trying to find it he called me a liar. He then proceeded to cover my mouth and my nose after I told him No. Him hovering over me probably half drunk holding me down cutting my oxygen I'm over gasping for air. Then he gets off of me and tells me to go in the garage. He goes in my room and takes ever enjoyment I had to get away from the world and throws it in a bag and \"throws it away\"( he put it upstairs and I didnt get it back till I did my hw) (I don't have a problem with that part but it's how it was proceed) But on top of that being horribly depressed I missed my sisters cuz I barely ever got to see them or even talk to them. My mother playing the blame card and I love you but just wanted more child support was horribly abusive to my sisters. My sisters would tell me she would put them in the corner for hours after school and she would leave the house and get fucked up or go out to eat while they stayed home sharing a can of ravioli straight out of the can. 5th grade me and dad and his bf move a couple hours away from we lived so new school... Again.. but new house new room. Same shit. They splurged on hot tubs and new tech. And then thanksgiving came around and dad asked if I wanted to do anything\" I wanna see my sisters\" he hated the thought of my mom being here at the new home. But he chose to do so. God I wish I didn't . Early thanksgiving day dads shit faced drunk. Cooking aka burning dinner. Then mom and my sisters arrive. I take them upstairs and my parents already go at it. Then my mom lies to my dad and tells him that I wanted to live with her. I said I wanted to see my sisters not live with my mom. So dad being drunk as he was starts crying then packs all my clothes and gives me away like I'm some orphan. (12 btw) So mom get her bf to pick us up after being there for Maybe 2 hours and I'm moving in with my mother... As I'm telling her no. No one is listening 👂🏼 at all. Then we get to her place from me living in a nice house to a ghetto apartment duplexes that smell of cigarettes and weed. Mind you my asthma hasn't been a problem with flare up TILL NOW. I get there thinking of I get my own room.. no I have a bed next to my mom's room. This was from 5th grade.. oh ya I had to repeat 5th grade since this leaving half way thru my mid year unannounced to anyone. So I'm literally in the same class as my sister who I'm 1 year older than her and everyone thinks we're twins. Till junior high in 8th grade I'm in this bedroom with my mother. Then during that time she had some dude named Jack who lived with us to get him back on his feet and instead of sleeping on the couch they decided oh boy well you can sleep in my bed where my son sleeps too.. he was a cool guy but a complete stranger. I barely knew the guy all I knew he liked to smoke weed and where guy thongs. Ya .. guy thongs. Apparently that's a thing aka gString or w.e. while my mother slept on the couch coushins down stairs with her bf smoking weed and pooping pills. Aka 🫐 blueberries.  Finally we go see Dad but end stay with him for the whole summer. Dad had just left his bf and was 10x worse living in a small apartment with no a/c even more cigarette smoke then moms and hardly any food. Then summer was over and come to realize mom had moved us into a new home. An actual house. I got my own room FINALLY. But my sisters were still sharing but there room was the master bedroom so it was pretty big to share. One thing tho. I HATE BRINGING THIS UP. As a kid the one good thing about having a dads bf who worked at a movie/comic book store he gave me pokemon cards up the wazoo. He was a real nice guy. I never had any issues with the guy. He didn't have kids so he tried to get to know me and take me out to movies I wanted to see he got my 1st Pokedex from radio shack. It was the coolest thing having a gen 1 Pokedex telling you all the facts. This is like early 2000 when it just hit us kids. Anyways. I had a butt load. And I had them organized in panels and covers. I took care of them. But when I got the news about the place I  looked in my room .all there was was my clothes and a old blue binder my mother gave me as a kid to write stories in. Nothing else. All my Yu-Gi-Oh pokemon and magic cards were gone. I was (14) and I was told to grow up. She threw them all away. Well he xbf at the time did. Knowing how much those cards could've been and being in Excellent condition and having a limited charizard. And losing everything  In a single summer. Crushed me even more. No sympathy. I literally had nothing but a tub under my full of all my stuff ... And gone because I needed to grow up.i played Yu-Gi-Oh every weekend with my friends and now that was gone too.  I started to go insane and then I started smoking pot around 16 to keep my shit calm but I started losing interest in certain things in school and skipping classes like art just to walk out and go get high. Or just to go to study hall with my \"friends\". Then the start of my junior year my sisters got on the bus. But I was told I wasn't getting on the bus. No. My mother decided to put me in homeschooling and not tell me til the 1st day school. After I've made plans to meet up with my friends like we did last year. But no I get stuck doing ECOT. Mind you we had a old ass computer she got from the 90s for me to work and I was limited to the Internet to look up certain things I needed for the program. Ppl got to face time there teacher while I got to chat in a box with mine if they responded. My mother got child support but she was so hyped on getting high we didn't see a lick of it. Everyone had USBs while I was the only one using a floppy disc. Y'know how embarrassing that is that the school work you worked on at home you couldnt present cuz the new PCs didn't have floppy disc space anymore. (This was freshman) My mom went out and got Papa John's the longest times and never had really any real food in the house unless it was microwaveable. (Well at least you had food) Sure but eating nothing but trash food aka junk food and having IBS and no diet guess who was still doing his shit in jr high and high school. So much anxiety at the time and just stinking like that being embarrassed being THAT GUY. Because your mom won't make a decent meal. I remember in elementary we went on a field trip but it was school related for 3 days. We got to sleep in a cabin. It was about the underground. Railroad. There was a bit where everyone had to hide in the attic and stay quiet.. well they cancelled that part cuz my stank ass. I knew it was me. Kids pointing laughing. I didnt want this. It hurt me more than anything. But I had no control. None..back to homeschool. It was horrible. Not the hw. But being home 24/7 my little sister and mom constantly fought. Throwing fists and her being bipolar on top didn't help. Then my sister would hit me cuz I did something she didn't like or she didn't like what I said. Abused by my own blood. Mentally now physically. ECOT was going well til they complained about me doing more work than I should.. I didn't skin threw it I'd actually Aced my grades and test. Even took a 2 years course in phycology in just if a year. Since I had nothing but time. My \"friends\" had there own lives. They had plans with each other and school. While I'm sitting on a computer all day with no access but work so I did just that just to be punished for it. I then get a call I'm 17 bout to be 18 that my father who I haven't talk or seen I a couple years since that summer. Lives in a studio apartment drunk and works miles away without a car because he had it revoked after a DUI. Big surprise. I felt bad for him. My life wasnt going anywhere. So I dropped out mid year of my senior year. I lived with my dad and did some side jobs till I turned 18 and I was legal to work at the same gas station as him. I lived in that small as apartment and slept on a water floatie on the floor for a year. We finally found a home itwas a duplex and it was literally a block away from our work. We worked at a (self owned shell station) it was a guy named Bill but the owner was a Indian guy. Anyways we lived there for a year maybe. The. We hired an accountant she was maybe 50 she was nice and seemed like she knew what she was doing. Till one day specifically my birthday I had a guy from Craigslist come over and drop off the new Xbox 360. New controllers new games. All I had was a PS2 with the hitman trilogy. So this was a big up. So on my break I was going to walk over to my place and have drop it off being only a block away. Then let's call her Hellen decided to offer me a ride so I can enjoy my break a lil longer. Sure cool w.e my dad seems cool with you. You just bought us some new dish ware for a house warming gift. Yada yada. I get it. Mind you it's pull out of drive way go right then it's right there. She goes out of the driveway the other way and goes towards the highway. I'm like uh you know where I live right. Then this crazy bitch goes on about our boss is a terrorist and we need to tell the FBI about this and we need to go to Kentucky (I was in Ohio) and go talk to the feds all this nonsense while I'm on the phone with my gf at the time. And she pulls my phone out of my hand and asks if she's in on it too. Bat shit crazy. So I had to convince her to get dad because he's been there the longest and he's seen it all. YOUR RIGHT LETS GO GET HIM TOO. Mind you my dad stopped drinking unless it was two days off in a row then he'd drink a night just from working so much we literally ran that store together. So we get to. My house finally about to grab my stuff and she's like no leave it here so I know you'll come back. Oh I didn't. But my father after I told him WTF was going on had a mental fucking break down on this woman. Grabbed the box of dishes she bought us and said if you don't give my son his shit I will bust every last bowl plate and glass over that fucking crazy head then curb stomp you then you can ask God instead of the feds why your so fucking crazy. So from then on in. It's so hard from me to get in a car with someone I have no history with. After a year I went to go visit my sister on my week vacation. Then my dad tells me don't come back we lost our job and we lost the house ... I was left with the bag of clothes once again and nothing else. I had to stay with my mom and now I'm sleeping on the couch cuz my other sister took my old room. Time goes buy and we all moved again cuz mom can't afford the house no more so she has to leave. I was living with a friend at that point working at speedway. Not knowing they were taking advantage of me and rent and food. Then kicking me out cuz I wouldn't go to work when my \"friend\" called off work we both worked at speedway just different locations. And no one would cover for him. Come to find out months later he gets fired for stealing from the register. Like hundreds of dollars. Doesn't get charged cuz he paid it back . But they terminated his ass. As for me I had to go back to my mom's in her new home. A duplex and my youngest sister who just had a baby got on the welfare and got an apartment next door to each other. Ha. Horrible idea. I got me a new job asap and it was a 12hr on one day off the next  kinda job. I went in really early so mom couldn't take me so I had to get a transbus fair. They come to your house pick you up hour before you had to go to work cuz they had to pick up everyone else and then drop you off. But at that time I was only working 8hr shifts mon thru Thursday. Then I was offered to get a new schedule doing 12s which I was young and was up for it. Plus job was cake. Well telling the bus driver this he gave me a number to let the ppl know so the bus driver knows about my new schedule mind you they came around 4 am. Well I go and apparently for 3 of those days I was off they came to my house still and then revoked my 6 month pass I worked so hard for. Cuz I called a number left a message they gave me and then they act stupid. And I couldn't tell the bus driver cuz it was a different person Everytime. So my mom took me to my job one time. And told me she just couldn't do it anymore it was too much. Granted it was a 20 min drive and it was at 5am when she didn't have to be at work till 1pm. So I lost my job. Two days later. My mom told me we were gonna go see our grandparents and go out to eat. Ok cool. I need it cuz all of this bs. COME TO FIND OUT SHE HAD MY 2 BAGS OF CLOTHES AND DROPS ME OFF AT A HOMELESS SHELTER! I've never been so betrayed in all my life. \"It's cuz of welfare I'm sorry\" even tho welfare didn't know I was living there for that small amount of time and I had a income. (Btw my sister the middle child lived with her and would tell her the rent went up this month so I need more money this month. They both worked at Arby's)( then she moved out lived in the city closer to work with our drugged up cousin and wouldn't give her rides to work cuz it was \"out of her way\" when my sister literally would pass her on the road on her bike.) ( some frosting to top that is that my sister wanted to go to college but she didn't want to go to the one my mom wanted her to go so mom forged her signature and then for almost a year she stole the money for her books while my sister is barely making anything to get buy eating ramen and moonpies while my mother is living it up) when I got dropped off I was still in town where we lived. But you drop me off where literally convicts live now and druggies too. I lived there for maybe a week and I left slept on my friend's mom's floor for almost a week and was being treated like trash there too. So I left again. Thankfully my grandma my mom's mom picked me up and took me in. I stayed for a month but I couldn't bare to stay there anymore cuz I couldn't just free load off of my grandparents. No one was hiring at the time or even near but my grandparents didn't live in the most friendly neighborhood either. So I left. About to go back to the homeless shelter then my old xgf mom who loved me like another son picked me up. Offered me a place to live and help around the house and they had a farm. Even tho I'm deadly allergic to hey and pollen I pushed my self to help until we can figure out what was going on. Then there were rumors of us sleeping together even tho one she's like a mother and 2 she had a man who was cool as hell who taught me how to cuz wood and make shit. My xgf was the problem. See we met in jr high thru one of my close friends. Me Q Mike and the girls Nikki and MJ. MJ being my x. In jr high I never had a gf. I had no confidence anyone liked me or even think that I wanted to even try since I moved so much. The mj came around and she was my 1st kiss and my 1st time. So I was stuck. Then she became a fucking slut and fucking Drug feen. (Heroin) High school we didn't talk much. She got expelled . But somehow the world kept throwing us back together. I was delusional and she knew she could get anything out of me. Hell I let her stay with me and my mom and sisters and my youngest sister found caps. Heroin. And she said it was her diabetes. I denied it was anything Else. I sold all my shit so she could get her fix hell I even went with her to go pick it up... I was so fucking stupid. She even had a kid and I took care of that kid for the 1st 2 years just to be told it wasn't mine. Even to this day that kid.. huh.. then years ago by and she gets out of jail. I have my own place with my sister staying too. Then she pops back in. Then she fucks with my shit again pregnant with another guys baby. Told her I'd be there no matter what went to ultra sounds. Worked o.t so she can get wme food she wanted then she went to her friends and didn't come back for 4 days. I picked her ass up and I called her mom. Come get her I'm done. The last day I talked to her was about my little sister going to jail cuz she was hugging fucking cans while her kid my nephew was in the car. My Mom not wanting to lose the kids so not saying anything. Then someone catches her in the Walgreens bathroom passed out PREGNANT with her son( my nephew) crying next to her. So CPS and cops were involved she got 2 years in jail. While this is happening no sympathy from MJ at all. All this shit I'm going thru and not a damn care. So I call her mom up and told her I'm done I can't do it anymore she broke me. Her mom gets her and she tells me she'll be back for her shit. I told her you take it now cuz what's left will be burned I promise you. I'm done with your selfish ways fucking Drug addict pregnant horrible fucking role model of a mother. After that she got back with the original baby daddy for the new baby. Couple years ago by. My sister gets out. I don't want nothing to do or say to her. I didn't talk to her the whole time she was in jail. I'm sorry but you dangered my nephew and my new born niece. And you can say I'm a bad guy but in reality the whole time she was gone and I got done with that whore. I worked my ass off. I payed for the mortgage for my grandpas house because when he passed he gave it to her not my mom . I made sure she had somewhere to go when she got back since her husband took her daughter as he should and left that place. I MADE SURE SHE HAD A FUCKING HOME! BUT I WAS SO FUCKING MAD AT HER I COULDNT EVEN LOOK AT HER IN HER EYES. ALL I SAW WAS A DEAD BEAT MOM AND A DRUG ADDICT AND ALL I WANTED WAS MY LITTEL SISTER BACK. I worked at a retirement home as a cook. She worked there 1st but when shit hit the fan she lost her job but I ended up taking her place. So the ppl knew her before all of the drugs. How much of a good mom she was before our moms xbf daughter came around and introduced her to the shit. When she got out I hugged her. That's all. When she was hungry I sent pizza with the couple of bucks I had to spare. My mom wouldn't even go help her when she had time or even spend time with her even tho she's was the one wanting to see her daughter again but she really didn't give a fuck cuz she got a new man to please( btw my sister was living with our grandpa cuz our of nowhere after our grandmother passed away her daughter that was living with them rent free left and didn't say a word so my sister left her welfare apartment to take care of our grandpa because he was the only one to make sure we had what we needed as kids. Granted so did our other grandparents but this one would buy cars for my mom left and right to make sure she could get us to point a to B and this man spent a good amount of money on her cars. And also might I add this isn't even her real father granddad adopted kids that were orphaned cuz the parents were too young to take care of them. So grandad adopted her along with 12 other kids. Then some would get adopted by other families and they would get different kids. But he treated those kids with respect and loved all of them. But he adopted my mom personally cuz he was waiting for her real mom to get her back. Eventually she did. My grandmother who gave away my mom felt so bad she named her next daughter the same name.. but she felt guilty thinking she never seen her again. But my mom was a spoiled rotten child. Her words. And she hated going to his house on the holidays only if she knew she was gonna get something out of it.) anyways mom took advantage and stayed with my sister and her \"dad\" stayed in full furnished sunroom Rent Free! On top of that met a nice guy named Sean and let him live with her and had loud sex whenever she wanted. Rent Free.  So when I was living with my other sister and her son which she had with a decent guy named Matt. Which is when I started the retirement job. Matt got too friendly and was getting drunk telling me he can have any woman he wanted and he's been talking to other girls. I was living with him at the time. But as soon as I got my 1st pay check. I asked my little sister (who was still clean at the time) if we could move in IDC if I had to sleep on the floor as long as my other nephew and our sister had a bed to sleep on. And that's what I did. When it was bed time I'd sleep on the shag carpet with some pillows and blanket and my sister and her son would sleep on the bed next to me. And since I offered to pay rent till we got our own place. (That's when my x showed back up) She started charging my mother rent and I told her don't feel bad for a bum when she's not a bum she's a freeloader. She had income but all she wanted to do is go in grandads old shed and smoke all her weed. We moved out all that happened she gets out of jail.. not even a week later.. she 💀 herself.. bullet In the head .. in the shed mom would smoke her weed. She felt alone scared useless. I regret that day so much cuz the day before she asked to hang out but I was ay worked stressed out pissed tired over worked and I didnt wanna deal with it  I was just an ass built up in anger.  The next day I get ready for work and go in everyone starts talking about a post my sister put up but she took it down. Ppl were worried. But my whole life she did this. If she's didn't get her way she do some bs. I just went to to work and I had to work a 16 hour shift on top of train a new worker. Dinner time runs up so I put my phone on the charger off. I'm training in line and I get a phone call thru the kitchen. It's my mother. Your sister is in the hospital. She shot her self. Thinking of she did something stupid again. So I run over to one of my co workers that's off work and they come rushing over and take over my trainee. I'm trying to get a hold of someone to take me to the hospital. None of my managers are picking up. Then I call my best friend who works there and she speeds over there. Meanwhile no one will pick me up to go to this hospital but yet they'll mom and her bf  go out of there way to pick up the other grandmother that's further away from me to get her than her own brother. So I'm bff takes me to the hospital. No one has said anything me. So I told her I'll update her when I can. I go in I'm in the waiting room. Still no one's telling me anything. Then I go in the room and am everyones like omg why'd she do this. But No ones is saying anything. Then mom comes up to me and goes you wanna see your sister. I'm pissed hell ya I wanna see her I wanna yell at her .. we go back there.... Ahhh ... I look at her and shes there laying a in a bed with a wrap around her head and still no one tells me anything then I look over there no heart thing no i.v. then I realize.... She dead.. this is how you tell me... I thought she was dramatic and shot something like her foot or something not Killing herself. There she was cold blue lips God .. I wish that wasn't the last thing I saw. But I thank God my other sister was living with my father at the time. My father isnt a bigot he's changed so much over the years and apologized for every wrong doing he did when we were kids and would do anything to be a better parent with what time he has left. But my mother... She thought it would be ok for me to see MY LITTLE SISTER DEAD LIKE IT WAS A SUPRISE PARTY FOR ME. I BALLED MY EYES FOR HOURS. I called my dad asking if sis and he knew and theyve known for hours. I told him no one told me .. they just made me see her with no warning or anything .. my father hates my mother more than anything in the world but I don't think he hates her more than I loathe her. That's the last thing your going to put in my head. (Another thing is she wanted to take a picture of her dead and send it to my sister so she can see it too) My father said if you do that I will personally go down there and slit your throat. How can you be so selfish why would you wanna see your dead daughter let alone you sister. So every 12 of July it's the hardest day. I go back and if I would've just took a day to talk to her and listen she probably still be alive. That guilt will always burden me and I will NEVER forgive myself. I just wished maybe the 3 attempts that I tried to kill myself and one actually worked maybe they would've been more close. I don't have a kid a wife or anybody to hold to call mine. But those babies would've been with there mama and if that's what would've taken Id do it in a heartbeat. Why did this sorry pos had to live and not her.

ATLEAST SHE WOULD E HAD A HUSBAND AND HER KIDS ITS NOT FAIR. I get laughed and made fun of from my looks or me having trouble thinking of the most simplist shit just too look like a fucking retard at the end of the day. I know kids whove done more with there life in 16 years than I have in 33. What's the point of I'm just going to be mistreated and taken as a fool friend or/and lover. Don't give me that God shit I'm sorry but if there was one why the fuck am I living in hell. I don't ask for much hell I give more than I ever take. Good karma wheres Mine. WHENS IT GONNA BE MY TURN! IM A GOOD PERSON DAMN IT! I DONT WANT A PITY PARTY I JUST WANT SOME DAMN RESPECT!

Wtf. Oh look it's the funny guy he's so funny such a nice guy. In reality it's just fucking empty lies. I'm not asking for a million dollars I'm not asking for power or wealth I just want to be treated like a NORMAL FUCKING HUMAN BEING NOT A FUCKING TOOL OR A ATM.  I sit here crying everyday cuz I get up trying to motivate myself and then I hear what's the point. Why not go to the closest fucking bridge and just end it why not just jump Into oncoming traffic and end it one great finale.the. I won't be a fucking Nussance to everyone.

I've had it before severely (I'm usually a bit depressed somehow,even if I'm doing really good) and I've only just realised how bad it's gotten. I feel numb and I don't feel like myself anymore.

I'm angry and disappointed at what I've become. I just maladaptive daydream now. And I've been pretty much ghosted by a love interest, so im freaking out and sad about that. What should I do? I don't like to tell people because they'll just fuss over me and I can't stand it. I don't want to go back to being treated like a fragile child.Yet I know I'm wasting my life and I despise it.

    "selftext": "Hello, I'm an 18 year old guy, and recently (5–6 months ago) I realized that I don't know what I'm doing. I feel like my life is a complete failure. I have so many shitty problems in my life, and it's so hard to deal with them all at the same time, every day.\n\nI have an obvious gambling problem. I drink a lot of alcohol (by myself as well). I use each addiction to escape from another addiction, which is so stupid and just makes everything worse.\n\nTo explain it, I have to start with one thing at a time. I was introduced to gambling by a friend about a year ago. It's not like I didn’t know what gambling was, but I had never *really* gambled for real, only on skinbetting sites etc. I got hooked instantly, and when I turned 18, it got even worse. I started gambling by myself in the evenings, losing all my money, blaming myself, and telling myself to stop. But three days later, when I got money again, I’d just gamble again and lose everything, literally everything in my bank account.\n\nThe worst part is that I *need* money so badly. I had an accident a few months back, where I caused damage to a rental car, and I don’t even have a driver’s license. On top of that, I have no idea what the repair fine is going to be. I read some reviews from people who made damages to the same rental car as well, and some were fined up to $7,500. That kind of money is a lot for me, I’m a student and don’t have a great income.\n\nI haven’t told my mom about it, and I’m so fucking scared to tell her, because money means a lot to her, and she’s already struggling financially. My dad isn’t really in the picture, he’s an alcoholic and drug addict, and has been my whole life.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? I know damn well that I shouldn’t have driven that car, and it was so stupid. Please give me some advice.\n\nI’m a smart guy, and I have no idea why I’m wasting my life like this. I feel like I’m just a piece of trash and don’t even matter.\n\nThe alcohol part is a bit different, because I don’t even know why I drink sometimes. It’s just out of pure boredom, and if I lose money on gambling, I feel like drinking will *help* or numb my thoughts.\n\nI really need some kind of advice to help me through this shitty situation , and please don’t tell me to get professional help, because I’m not ready to come out to my mom about all my problems.",

    "selftext": "This is a venting session for the high-functioning depressants of the world, the ones who most people wouldn't guess are depressed because they appear so successful/put together.  It's just a personal account that even though I've done X in my life (a lot of things which I should probably be proud of but honestly don't feel anything about), I still feel like shit and am frustrated.  Edit: I've been depressed since I was 15.5 and am now 29 (F).\n\nI was severely depressed my last two years in high school, but no one would’ve known it.  I was a model student.  I was active in my community and school.  I was president of student council my senior year and graduated as Valedictorian.  I got into a good college.  But I was also suicidal.  I partook in self-harm.  I was proud I didn’t kill myself.  I hated my body and my face.  I had some friends but still felt socially alone.  I felt disconnected from my family.  I was so antsy to leave high school, thinking college would be amazing.  Everyone talked about how great college was, how fun it was, how many friends they made.  I couldn’t wait.  I thought my life would finally feel fulfilled in college.\n\nCollege also turned out to be difficult.  Due to where I had been living in high school, college was a huge culture shock, and I struggled navigating relationships.  I joined clubs (from athletic to service-oriented to ROTC), was a student-worker, held leadership positions, hosted social events, initiated activities with the people I knew, fostered a dog, did corky things that aligned with who I was but were not things most people wouldn't do, joined a local Crossfit, and was more active in my community than the average college-student was.  I attempted dating for the first time, created an online profile, met lots of people, slept with lots of people, and didn't judge the people I swiped on based on their appearances.  And yet I struggled to make lasting connections with anyone during college, despite feeling like I tried very hard to get involved and meet people and cultivate relationships.\n\nAs an adult, I’ve continued to actively participate in life.  I was in the military and was stationed overseas for two years then back in the US for my last two years.  During this time, I traveled, alone and with friends and with family.  I bonded with some of my co-workers.  I started and finished my Master’s.  I’ve dated and met and slept with more people.  I picked up new hobbies and tried things out.  I was still unfulfilled and felt disconnected from the world.\n\nOkay, I thought.  Once I get out of the military and do something I’m passionate about, things will change for me.  I delved into research for the work I wanted to do next.  I emailed tens of organizations, asking for career advice.  I had informational interviews.  I established my own internship with an office I thought would propel me to my next career.  I moved for this opportunity, despite finally feeling like I was finally building a community in the location I was.  \n\nThe internship was a bust.  It provided no career prospects, no networking, no direction on what to do next.  I’ve applied for hundreds of jobs and got nothing (I’ve worked a few odd jobs instead).  My social-circle in my current location hasn’t been good.  My confidence in myself and future goals began to shake.  I decided to apply to law school.  I’m set to start law school in a few months, but I’m so worried this is going to be a repeat of what I’ve already been doing.  I always think the next chapter or new location is going to change something, but how can it change when I’m the same person partaking in that chapter?  \n\nI’ve read and listened to a good amount of self-help material.  Some of it is insightful or offers a new perspective, but most of the time I don’t understand how someone wrote this book and made money off of it, especially when a lot of them say the same thing.  How could others not know this information?  Of course you should have a positive attitude about life.  Of course your attitude dictates your life.  Of course everyone has their own perspectives.  Of course you can only control yourself.  Of course you need to be emotionally mature.  Of course you should be grateful and kind to others.  Of course you need to get out of your comfort zone to change your life up.  Of course you can’t just wallow in your self-pity and expect nothing to change (although I feel like you can wallow and still do things to propel your life forward).  I’m currently reading a book that talks about really living the life you want.  You have to think it and breathe it and then the Universe will give it to you.  \n\nThere are parts to this I get.  I know I should improve on the thoughts I tell myself to improve my self-worth.  I know if I meditated consistently everyday this would solve a lot of my problems.  (I honestly feel like that’s the answer to all my problems, but I still don’t do it despite my best intention to).  But outside of that, I feel like I’ve gotten out of my comfort zone and said yes to opportunities and embraced/shown my true self to the world and been vulnerable to others and tried to direct my life in the passions I want to work in and done lots of activities and kept my body active, but it’s been for naught.  I feel like I must be doing life wrong.  My social circle is such shit.  I literally have one in-person friend where I currently live.  I have one friend from high school whom I still talk to, but that relationship isn't what I’d like it to be.  My family is here and I see them a lot, but I feel very disconnected with them even when we’re together.  My dating history has been shit.  I know I was a really good partner to each of them and breaking up was never b/c of something I did (I know; this is probably what every psycho-toxic person thinks, but I know my truth).  I always hear that I’m a really kind and dependable and unique person, and I know I'm good with people, but it doesn’t reflect in my social life.  A big reason is I move a lot (and did as a kid too so don't have many childhood friends) so it takes a while to make friends, and by the time I get close with people, I move again.  Or my partner was my major social circle, but then we break up, and then I have to rebuild my circle, and then I move.  It also doesn't help that I also have pretty high expectations of what a companion should do/be as I treat people who are important in my life with a lot of care/curiosity/love that I don't feel is reciprocated (adding to my feelings of isolation).  I’m going to move for school soon so I’m in that weird limbo again where I don’t want to make an effort to meet people, but I'm also super lonely.\n\nI know I’m still young and I’m going to start school soon and that is going to be a change, but it’s just so frustrating to feel like I constantly get out there and be my true self and live my values and am comfortable doing things alone and have made life-changing decisions that I think will get me to where I want to be and am generally a really good person but still feel so stuck and unfulfilled.  Humans need strong relationships and a purpose.  I feel like despite my best efforts, both of those seem to severely lack in my life. I feel like some other people are so lucky with their relationships (friendships and partners) yet didn’t have to try that hard for them. I just thought at 29 I’d feel more satisfied with my life.  Or at least have a really good companion (whether friend or partner) in my life.  I know when I was 18, I definitely thought my prospects would've gotten better 10 years later, but it hasn't.\n\nTLDR: Even though this post is all about me, it’s a way to acknowledge us high-functioners.  The ones, who, like me, feel like they’ve tried to make something of their life despite the depression, are often a bigger participant in life than the average person and yet, like me, haven’t reaped the rewards yet.  You’re not alone, and I hope our time comes when we’ll feel fulfilled in our lives. \n\nAnd yes, I’m in therapy and am on meds.  I haven’t been impressed with therapy in general (but continue partaking in it), and I probably need a dosage boost for my meds.  And yes, I try to understand what brings me joy so I can direct my life towards that, but I don’t really know what it is, which is why I continue trying new things, and maybe law school will help get me there.  And no, I can't have a pet b/c my life is too volatile and I wouldn't be able to take care of the pet in the way I'd like to and wouldn't currently want to commit having a pet for however long its life is.",

I have to come up with rent for this month, a security deposit for the new place, and the rent for the new place but I have no idea how. I hate this place so much. It's so small, and the people across from me smoke weed. So I always have to keep my window closed because the smell travels into my place and lingers. I absolutely hate the smell of weed. And every time I look at this place or move around in it, it aggravates me. The rent is ridiculous for what it is. At first I was okay with it. But the more things I got and bought, the more I realized how much little space I have. I'm always bumping into things and ugh, it pisses me off!\n\nI have a job after not having one for months. I thank God for that, but it doesn't start until next week. This puts a wrench in things because now I won't have enough money to pay all of my bills (including this month's rent) or to move out. I'm just so tired man. I want to scream and cry and punch things. I don't have money for my car payment, my car insurance was canceled because I didn't have enough to pay it. So now I can't even drive to work because I don't want to get arrested for driving without insurance. I feel so helpless man. I hate this. I've been applying for loans but I've been getting rejected despite my credit being Good and all of my car payments have been paid on time. I don't know what to do. I don't want to kill myself. I just want to get out of this mess and stop living paycheck to paycheck. It's exhausting. \n\nEven though I start this job next week, it won't be enough to pay my rent, my car payment, the payments to reinstate my car insurance, the security deposit for the new place, my phone bill, and the rent for the new place before the end of this month. \n\nI can't stand living where I'm at now, but it feels like I'm here for a long time. And then it's been hard finding friends and finding someone to date. I'm getting older and I've never had a serious, healthy, long-term relationship. I feel like I'm just running out of time and it's overwhelming me. There's no one who I can talk to and I'm just so tired man. I'm so angry and fed up. Just want this situation to end. And I know the saying about not making a permanent solution for a temporary problem. And I love God and trust Him. I'm just so done with this situation and want it to end. I feel so stuck and I can't think of any immediate solutions",

I hate myself and everyone else but my girlfriend and even she doesn't like me.\nI want to rip my skin off and jump off a building because I can't keep trying in a life I don't want. My parents are great sure sometimes they're extremely dramatic or rude but I know they want me to live a good life. It just feels like there's a voice in my head that says it's just a ruse. I'm spoiled to death while my parents started from scratch and made it up to my dad making quarter million with my mom now I'm med school. I live in a life where I get almost everything I want but all I want is friends, genuine friends. I've grown up so alone to the point I threw all of my friends away and didnt even realize I've been in some terrible relationships where the girls spread rumors all about me and now I can't make friends. I stare at my roof as I bang my head against a wall or just sometimes stare at my roof for hours doing nothing and I don't have enough energy to move. I want to be a striker in soccer, I want to be a soccer player which is probably way out of my world when I'm only now starting about to enter highschool in a year, I just feel like I'm a disappointment. My parents wanted me to be better be the 4th person in my giant family to go to college but at the rate I'm going I won't even get out of this grade. I'm an idiot I don't know how I had straight A's last year which now it was probably because my meds worked then. \nI'm probably one of the kids who lives the life of a ton of people's dreams but if I'm being honest if you grew up with the other side you would love it but if you grew up with this and you're happy I dont know how you are. We don't get to achieve anything on our own or put hard work and it's made me an absolute pussy. I faint around bugs I don't know how to change a tire or anything about fixing shit. I can fix computers for people but all I did for money was dog sitting and I made probably $500 total and now I sit with not even 10 bucks. Once I get to school I'm supposed to fight one of my \"friends\" they lied their way out of everything and now he wants to fight me. I think it's what I deserve I don't know if I want to fight back. I dont know how much longer I can even hold onto living it's so fucking painful. I feel so bad for my girlfriend I want to give her the world but I can't. I care for her and she knows that but I think she's too scared to leave me. Anyways I guess that's all I can think of right now to anyone else who lives a life like this or is just straight up living in misery I get what you feel. I can't do shit but you have to find the right person or thing that keeps you alive because right now she's all I have.\n\nEdit: Got a huge project in my geography class not worried about it. My girlfriend chose her ex over me with a friend she doesn't even like. She was all over him like putting her hand on his chest when she was laughing. I love her but now I'm sure she doesn't. Think I might end it here.",

For the past few years I've just been feeling useless, suicidal, these last few months have completely destroyed me. I lost my bestfriend to suicide November last year, and without him I felt useless, no more fun game nights, no more 5 hour calls. No more Lenard... No nothing... After that event, I became more suicidal. I planned to kill myself on december 18, my school's christmas party. I mixed Bleach and rubbing alcohol making chloroform, I drank a full cup if it. It still didnt take effect, it failed. Then when christmas break happened, I became even more suicidal, I planned another date again. This time, January 24th. This time I was sure I was gonna die, I had expensive ass rope. But something happened, I confessed to a girl, her name was Chloe. She liked me back, and I felt happy again. For the first fucking time, after 4 years, I actually felt happy for the first time. No words cannot describe of how much happy I was with her. Then, I changed... I changed so much. I started eating more, I started meditating, I stopped touching blades. I actually felt that I had actually found my life. She was the only one who could make me ease my anxiety, I felt... HAPPY ... For the first time, I actually started healing, words cannot describe how much I loved her and how I loved the world back then. The relationship was so healthy, if I wasn't talking to her I was either sleeping, or sleeping(no its not a typo). But then, March came around.\n\nMarch 2, Where it all fucking came down. She left me, left me to rot, Left because she felt \"uncomfortable\" because with her fuckass \"Avoidant Attachment\" issues. Left me at my happiest to \"soften\" the blow, but it only made me fall harder. I dont even know what words to describe the feeling. Its like the feeling of being plunged deeper into the hole you tried so hard to get out of, it felt crushing. I am depressed again, and now more suicidal. Now I'm this fuckass reddit page to please, help me. How do I make cyanide so I can end my fucking life, I cant take this anymore. I dont want this \"You have so much left to live for\" bull shit.

I changed doctors and tried sertraline, which gave me some relief, but sadly it didn’t reverse my condition and eventually stopped working.\n\nSince then, I’ve tried dozens of medications, cerebrolysin, and even ECT — none of them helped.  \n\n\nI’ve tried the following antidepressants: sertraline, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, clomipramine, paroxetine, mirtazapine, fluoxetine with olanzapine, amitriptyline, fluvoxamine, bupropion, and tianeptine.  \n\n\nAmong antipsychotics, I’ve taken: aripiprazole, risperidone, amisulpride, quetiapine and lurasidone.  \n\n\nOther treatments I’ve tried include: cerebrolysin, amantadine, pramipexole, rasagiline and 6 ect sessions  \n\n\nNow what?

I have a good source of income, but I don't really have any friends, or a partner, or any hobbies. I like cars, and video games, but I dont have enough money or time to be into cars as much as I want to be, and games have been getting boring for me since I was 14. I cant get much interest in anything, I tried to get into drawing but I can't come up with anything. I'm not a very creative person. I guess to really get into when all this started, in 2023 I got medically discharged from the Marine Corps after almost breaking off my knee cap during training, and after coming home I felt like such a failure, I tried asking online for help to deal with the loss and everyone kept telling me how much of a failure I was. I tried going to therapy but that wasn't helping either. I wanted to re-enlist, this time in the Air Force but it kind of fell through after some issues with MEPS. So now I'm stuck with nothing. I have a full time job but I wasn't really feeling like I was going anywhere. So I thought maybe I should move out, start a little more fresh in a new area. It took a little bit of a toll on my finances, but I was able to power through and not live paycheck to paycheck. It was okay, but without any social life it grew lonely really fast.. I had a roommate, and they're the reason I moved back into my parents. They would mess with me, like turn off my access to the wifi and act like its working just fine. Through the rest of 2024 it was just the same, wake up goto work come home watch youtube and goto sleep. In 2025 I got a second job and it helped a little with my undiagnosed depression, but it didnt fully get rid of it. Also on the topic of depression I wanted to talk about suicidal thoughts because I wouldn't say I have any, and I wouldn't inflict pain on myself, or on others, but if something happens to me like a bloody nose, or throwing up, or getting cut/scratched with something I don't really care. I kind of like the sting of getting cut. Also I've been in a couple of near death experiences through 2024 because I drive on the highway a lot, and I realize that I never flinch or realize that something is about to run me into the side wall. But anyways, my schedule these days is usually goto work for 13 hours and come home, my only free day is sunday and thats the day if I need it I'll go get a hair cut. But I dont really have any time to hang out with anyone, and whenever I want to no one wants to hang out with me but they want to hang out with everyone else or go to some random event. I don't know what to do, or what I want.. can anyone help me??\n\n",

Usually I do at least try to reach out via saying hey I feel this way but I don’t know what’s the real point. If it hasn’t made me feel better in the past then why now? I’m not posting this looking for someone to talk to, just want my thoughts to be out there. I can’t even pinpoint why exactly I feel this way. It’s just a collective of being lonely both romantically and friends wise. Me missing Matt bit only because of attachment issues, I know realistically I wasn’t too happy with him. Missing Penelope, she was the only reason I didn’t hang myself those nights ago and had some joy in my life. My job being so repetitive and working alone just makes me feel shitty too. I feel behind in life in general even tho realistically I’m not but I’m definitely not doing the best. I’m a shit student, can’t lock in for shit. I don’t feel very attractive. I feel like I’m in a constant cycle of doing the same shit every day. I do try to fix things I’m not just complaining just to do it no I’ve done my part of trying but it’s so hard to keep trying. I used to think maybe I just need to hang out with a friend to feel better and for the most part that is true just last weekend I hung out with my friend and felt some excitement, but that type of shit doesn’t really last. To me it’s like smoking a cigarette you feel great in the moment, but it all goes away at some point ( mind you have never spoken a cigarette)\nOnly thing making me happy for the past few months has been when Matt would be nice to me. Made me feel special and important to a degree. I’m actually thinking about starting to talk to him again because I do miss him, but he doesn’t give a shit about me. Obviously he hasn’t even thought to text me since things happened. Could always come up to my job literally a confirmed location where I’ll be every single day with confirmed times only 20 minutes away. But he wouldn’t do that. He was never the type. I don’t think he ever showed up to my job. I would beg him all the time because I did want to see him and it would be really nice even offered to come up to his job I’m getting off topic. I feel like a loser I am a loser. I hate when I tell someone that and they say no you’re not. They usually proceed to say shit like I have a job. I have some money in my savings, but having that doesn’t necessarily make me not a loser in my everyday life I am a loser. I can call all of my contacts right now I’m super confident no one would answer. Wouldn’t even get a text back saying hey or a call back most of the time. I don’t feel like I have friends everyone feels like an acquaintance. But yea anyway idk all I can think about is what’ll happen from me dying. Shit like my funeral, why would come how people would find out and react. I don’t see myself as a real person. When I think of myself especially recently I don’t see me it’s hard to explain but I’m watching myself from 3rd perspective. I feel like a ghost just watching myself already. It’s not that I want to die but I don’t want to keep living this experience of being me dealing with my emotions all the time and not only feeling but knowing I’m just not very idk the word but important special I have no real purpose I don’t feel like I’m living I’m simply just here. Not waiting for anything to happen but I’m literally just here but alone. \nThinking about telling said therapist about this but i know she can’t fix this. She literally said she doesn’t know what to do when i was talking to her about how hard ive been trying to get friends or a relationship of any kind with people. Maybe im the problem, i go back to look at all my post over the years on here and nothing has changed. Hoping i get in a fatal crash tonight and every night till it happens on my way home or I will finally lock in go figure out that car shit. High key a lot more I can say that’s bothering me but too lazy to say fr. Im tired guys, and i miss Penelope. I’d really like to go see her again. ",

To give a gist of what is going on in my life, I was an amazing student, top of the class, never missed a day that kind of girl, but life hit me hard after leaving high school. I have depression since childhood due to bullying and other things and I have always been quite insecure about my looks and the fact that I don't like to be very social, so first semester of uni, I tried to be more social, take care of myself, make friends, but in this process I screwed up academically. I studied really hard for one month and then burnt myself out and got screwed. Now this semester, I took some easier courses along with some hard ones to make it easier on myself, but I just found out I failed a course and I don't know what to do. Currently I have a rough idea of my other courses, their grades and everything, but this just crushed me. I am contemplating giving up. My dream is to be a surgeon, finish undergrad in 3 years and zoom into medical school, but I am screwing up. I don't know what to do. Am I worthy of being alive? Should I just end it all? \n\n  \nI know I am info dumping with this post but any sort of advice would be greatly appreciated. ",

Forced to move multiple times because the toxic parent didn't take into consideration his family when he decided his career path. Forced into a life with disorders that make it nearly impossible to ever have a normal relationship. Forced to deal with the toxic parent who verbally and psychologically has abused me for the past 16 years.\n\nI can't take it much longer.\n\nI've been told I have it much better than half of the world population. I'm white, live in rural America, and my parents' income is relatively large and stable. If that's the case, then I'm completely worthless; a spoiled dipshit who doesn't provide anything positive to the world other than some shitty Minecraft videos. I hate work, I'm lazy, antisocial, and will likely be unable to make income capable of sustaining myself. I have no capability of working with people due to my disorders, and that's pretty much all anyone values these days. And I'd rather kill myself than live with my dad for the rest of my life (he's the toxic one who provides 90% of our family's income). \n\nThe world is evil.\n\nThis life I've been forced into is cruel. It's fucked up. Only evil people can be truly powerful, and the nice ones are more often than not the ones who get killed or completely ignored. I don't care if I have copious entertainment devices that supposedly keep me happy. My life is still fucked. I'll never be able to have a shred of success without friends to leech off of and eventually betray. And even that I'm too lazy for. I never want to go outside, never want to do anything other than play Minecraft and ignore the world around me. Because the world around me is fucking miserable.\n\n  \nI have a few skills, but they're useless.\n\nI can write, but guess what? AI exists, and those evil people ruling the world are going to make it impossible to profit off of it. I can game, but I'm too lazy to make decent videos. I can code, but it makes me want to kill myself even more than I already do, and that's saying a lot.\n\nI am worthless to all but a couple of people.\n\nPeople fucking hate me. I used to be incredibly creepy and say sexually explicit things because bro culture made me think that was acceptable. I get most of my personality from (guess who?) my toxic-ass father. I can never take anything seriously around people. I can't provide anything to conversations except for stupid or offensive jokes. I often get caught looking at tits. I am disgusting. My mom values me, likely because if I didn't exist she would've either 1) left dad, or 2) killed herself. I love her, but she may not be enough to live for. Not if we're locked in with this guy because we couldn't support ourselves if we left.\n\nNothing significant is going to happen to the majority of people because I don't exist one day, and that's all that matters to society. I can't live a normal life even if I wanted to. Creativity is being crushed by the evils. I'm a horrible person. I'm going to die soon, whether it's because of me or because of someone else's evil / negligence. ",

    "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I’m a 17-year-old guy, and I can’t shake this feeling that I’m missing out on so much during my teenage years. It feels like I’m falling behind in life, especially socially, and it’s really weighing me down.\n\nMy parents and siblings constantly tell me I’m “slow,” and I can’t help but notice how sharp and clever other people seem when they talk with their friends. It’s like everyone has things figured out, while I feel naive. I don’t have much to do during the day except scroll through TikTok and YouTube, and I don’t even have a group of friends to do things like go to prom or school events with. I have school friends, but we never hang out outside of class, which just makes me feel even more isolated.\n\nI try to talk to people, but it often feels like I’m talking to a wall. Their responses are dry, and I can’t help but feel like they’re not really listening. In group settings, I get ignored, and it’s like no one cares about what I have to say. Meanwhile, everyone else seems to be bonding, laughing, and having fun. It’s like I don’t have the same pull that others do.\n\nI’m in my senior year of high school, and honestly, I hate my life. The social aspect of high school is stressing me out a lot. At the beginning, I had a solid friend group that made me feel like I belonged. But as high school went on, I drifted away from them and started hanging out with a different group. Even though I knew this group wasn’t really my vibe, I stuck with them. Over time, I realized they weren’t a good fit for me. They’re boring, and hanging out with them just feels off.\n\nLast summer was especially hard. I felt so isolated and lonely, no one reached out, and I spent days doing nothing. Now, in my senior year, I’m still stuck with the same group at school. I don’t really consider them my friends, but I feel trapped in this situation because of my one friend, Jack, who is in this group too. I miss my old group of friends who were so much more fun, funny, and interesting. But now it feels like it’s too late to reconnect with them, and I’m stuck with a group that’s just holding me back.\n\nI didn’t enjoy hanging out with Jack and his friends—they were boring and lacked any real humor or interests. I missed my old group because they were so much more fun, outgoing, and just cooler overall. They also had no problem talking to girls, which made them seem more confident and social. My current group doesn’t talk to girls, and they can be super awkward around them. Hanging out with them has made me feel more boring, and I can’t help but feel like I would’ve had better chances with a girl if I was still with my old friends. I feel like I’ve missed out on so much because of this, especially during last summer when I felt incredibly isolated and lonely.\n\nI feel like I’m fading into the background, and I don’t know how to get out of this rut. I don’t know how to fix things or what to do to feel more connected to people my age. Anyone else feel like this, or have advice on how to make a change?",

    "selftext": "I've tried to establish healthy habits and follow depression advice and I always fail. I'm easily persuaded by my vices and temptations (weed, binge eating, scrolling, etc.). I go to therapy and I can't commit and I forget to take my meds and I feel like I've got so many knots and loops in my brain that when I untangle one or just start to pick at the mass of strings it brings in another wave of pain and \"why try\". I've wanted to die for three years straight and genuinely think I'm a hopeless, empty, broken human being. I cry at everything and can't speak to people. It is almost unbearable. My brain has been trained to find the negative in everything and I try to have fun and it takes an exhausting amount of effort and then I go home and ruminate and isolate. My family has given up on me, my friends are tired, and I'm ashamed of who I am. Most advice and reassurances make me feel worse, especially when given by people who don't know me. \"I'm sure you are great\" \"Everyone has value\" etc. etc. I want to be someone I'm proud of and I'm not sure that I have it in me, and I sure as hell am not that person (yet?). Every community I've tried to join has rejected me, every man I've ever been with has ultimately told me I'm not worth their time. People tell me I'm strange and do things weird and I'm \"quirky\"\n\nHOWEVER, I can't kill myself. I want to so bad but I can't, I'm scared of the pain. And if I can't kill myself, I might as well try while living. It's basically my only option, and the dissonance of talking a big game about who I want to be and what I value and not following through with any of that has become more uncomfortable than wallowing and suffering.\n\nIf I am going to suffer in my bed and wake up every morning crying, I might as well suffer at the gym or going on a walk or having a painful 30 minute interaction with someone. I might as well feel like absolute dog shit while doing the dishes and cleaning up the house, or attempting to focus on a page of a book while retaining nothing. I'll cry in the work bathroom and then go do my shift and mess up everyone's orders but at least I'm doing something.\n\nI'm guessing that there are other people who struggle with consistency here and have simultaneously lost all hope and any zest for life, who are completely ashamed of who they are but also go through the motions, or try to do what is supposed to be good because it's like, what else am I doing? TV or video games or movies never worked for me so maybe it's just a result of having literally 0 escapism without binging or smoking weed (I don't even like smoking weed anymore lol) but I guess it's a combo of looking good for others, seeing what I can do, and a tiny little itty bitty sliver of hope??? I don't know. I've gotten bored of my vices and they are so addictive so I'm almost trying to seek novelty in the \"good\" even if it all makes my insides feel like scrambled eggs that I'll puke up at any moment.\n\nThis probably makes no sense and I'm wondering if anyone feels this same way. I'm looking for a balance of talking about the depression side of things cuz it's fucking heavy and real and cuts through everything, but also I guess a hopeful nihilism? Or just an empowering \"fuck it\". I don't know if this helps anyone but I'm looking to check in for myself and for others, and honestly a reason to keep going this morning. \n\nDisclaimer that I know everyone processes things differently and is in a different boat and has different circumstances. If you think what I'm saying is a crock of nothingness then I totally get it and keep rockin and doing what is good (or not good) for you. I know I fluctuate so much that I could read this in an hour and want to punch in my computer screen.

I got to go work!\" She tried to slam the door of furnace room she tried to hide at, so I opened the door and was fed up with her immature behavior before that happened and yelled \"Your 18! Grow up! I'm trying to make hours!\" Ig she didn't like that and we soon started fighting in front of the kids, it isn't like I wanted to fight, she attacked me and to I defended myself, after the fight I called my mom crying, telling her I didn't want to work since I was overwhelmed and already msged my boss and he understood. And since we lived near my granny, she made it there first before my mom, who at the time was working, and so my granny scolded us, even though I tried to tell her she attacked me, but didn't want to to listen, after she did she left, and my mom went home, I told her what happened and my mom was beyond angry at my sister, since she tried to leave the kids unattended while I tried to go work. The last time she attacked me was in front of the kids again, I don't remember why, or how it happened but it ended with me having a slight bruise on my cheek, at that time she met her now husband, he came from the town over and stayed with us ever since, and after she attacked me my mom had enough of that and said, \"the next time you attack your little sister, I'm going to tell her to take the kids to mums (my granny's) and I'm gonna lock all the doors and windows and we're gonna fight, and I'm not stopping until one of us is on the floor and bleeding, I don't care if they call the cops, I don't care if they try stop me, beans my brothers know, no one's gonna stop me, not even mum. So quit it. Smarten up!\" And then she took us out in the truck and told my sister to clean the mess we made when she attacked me. The. There's my oldest sister. I'll call her Lyndsay, she was my bully, no one ever bullied me but her, well....it started off with her. And she was my bully the day we came to where we live now, when I was 4, she's 7 years older then I am. And ever since then, she made it her life's mission to exclude me from the family, or at least those that were around me, like my little brother. Allis and my uncles that's the same age of Allis, rez right? Lol. But anyways. She mocked me, put me down, and tormented me to the point I started gaining weight, she also isolated me from friends. Any friends I'd make she'd make sure to bully and hurt me to make me cry or look too embarrassing to be with, and it worked. I never had a friend. I never had a childhood. I grew up an adult before I was a teenager. And it's breaking me. I'm lost. I'm scared. And I want to run....I need help but never knew where to look....help me get better. I need to learn how to live...I don't know anything. And I'm 21. I never graduated...I want to die.",

    "selftext": "I no longer feel the need to kill myself when I get sad. I just feel this deep, sense of self loathing. I feel useless. My guardians yell at me everyday, about how I don't do enough around the house, how my grades are too low, how I'm too disrespectful, how I complain about the bare minimum. I can't tell if it's me or them. I told my school counselor some of the things they've said, and she said I was indeed, not in the wrong. That was nice to hear. One of my guardians thinks because I'm bipolar that any opinion that contradicts or incriminates her is a delusion of mine. That in and of itself could be a delusion, but according to many other third party opinions, its not. I broke my two month clean streak. I know when my doctor finds out shes going to be heartbroken. I want to stop. But at the same time as I tell myself to stop, another voice is telling me that I'm going to get in trouble anyways, might as well do it as much as I need to. At this point I feel I have no one to talk to. My guardians just tell me what I'm doing wrong, and that I'm the problem. When I apologize for my faults they rub it in, which in turn upsets me and makes me question their faults, which they deny or blame on my wrong-doings. My mom will make me feel a little better by telling me its not my fault, but then she'll tell me how good life would be if I lived with her. And I believe her. But I don't want to. Due to my bad past, which happened in her custody, many people in my life would be disappointed if I went back with her, and I would have to uproot my whole life. My counselor just tells me what I can do differently to avoid conflict with my family, but my point of view is, I shouldn't have to. They're adults, why do they take the time of day to argue with a teenager? Why do they take to time of day to degrade a teenager? Whose self confidence is already in the mud. I my girlfriend...my poor, sweet girlfriend. She's the light of my life. I don't know what I'd do if I didn't talk to her everyday. But I can't talk to her. She has her own problems, and I don't want to burden her with mine. I don't want her to worry about me. My doctor told me that if she finds out I've started hurting myself again she'll put me back in the hospital. At this point I'm thinking that it's probably for the better, I know I'm not going to stop any time soon. Any time my guardian sets me off (every other day as of late), my first thought is how marks I'll be adding. I go to a symphony with my doctor next weekend. I'm deciding when she asks how I've been if I'm going to omit the part about me hurting myself, or if I'm going to give her the whole truth. I physically can't lie to that woman. Even if I'm technically lying by omission, I can't just--untruth. My guardians will be mad at me if I tell her. They get mad every time I tell somebody other than them. But if I tell them, I won't get adequate help. But if I don't tell her, then she'll be extremely upset when she does find out (which she always does), and I'll feel guilty for not telling her. I love her so much, and she has verbalized that when I hurt myself, it hurts her. That when I'm not doing good, she's not doing good. I feel selfish knowing that me hurting myself brings tears to her eyes, yet I continue to do it. I just don't understand where I went wrong. When I went wrong. When the period of time is where they decided that I was useless. I just wish they understood how sick I am, and how much worse they make it. God knows I love them more than I'll ever love myself-and possibly anyone else for that matter.",

    "selftext": "I am just clueless about what I can do to take this weight off myself, other than sharing it here. Since the virus, nothing has been the same. Just after that virus' quarantine ended, I started 6th grade, and it was great because I could finally reunite with my friends I knew since kindergarten at school, and all wasn't so bad. The thing is, I didn't do so, even though I wasn't called anything and was just there in the class, and even though probably nobody noticed, I slowly started becoming quieter and quieter, and with time, when I reached 7th grade, entering middle school, I was already a \"quiet kid.\". The problem; I had to change schools and after having to cut physical ties with friends thanks to the virus and failing to get along again, now I had to make the effort of making new friends that were and still as of now are totally unknown to me.\n\nIn 7th grade, I could very well keep up with my grades, but not with people, and I started to get bullied by another kid who was repeating the grade. In the second or third trimester, if I remember correctly, I fell in love with a girl in my class and somehow sent her a love letter for Valentine's; I obviously got rejected. Because I got rejected, I felt bad, pretty bad, and my foolish brain at the time decided it was a good decision to ask out another girl, one of the few people I could minimally get to know in the whole class by then, so I wouldn't get lonely; I got rejected again, plus I'm almost sure she hates me now. Some days during that time I felt that I was a bit loved, others that I wasn't loved, and on one of those days I decided to protect myself from the bully. I got called on for it, but I was lucky enough for teachers to understand what was going on, and he got a warning; not like that stopped him from continuing to bully me anyway.\n\nSome time after that, in 8th grade already, I actually got asked out on by a girl, and those are some of the few happiest days I've had in my teenage years by now, the bad part, she cheated or me, either that, or she didn't want me anymore and used that as an excuse. I was destroyed. I decided real relationships weren't worth it anymore, therefore I dipped myself into the internet and video games even deeper, making online but actual friends in one of those video games I could talk to when I felt however I felt, and for some reason I fell in love with one of them, trying to make it better and advance slowly this time.\n\nOn the other side, the sad, and real life, it was like it didn't exist except for grades and a few \"exceptional\" experiences I could save off the boredom of what is high school while I kept getting bullied by the same guy as last year. In April of 2024, if I remember correctly, my, again, dumb, attention-seeking, fool and egoist self decided it was a nice idea to top my enjoyment of the online web by sharing nude pictures of myself, at that time a 13-year-old boy, through the web, Discord, and beyond. What I didn't expect was to actually be successful with them and get thousands of views and people asking to \"trade.\" It seemed great, but, of course, I ruined it.\n\nMy happiness-repelling self, again, decided one day that a bad idea was a good one and started giving \"hints\" of my \"business\" to my online friends, who were few of the only people I cared about. Before one of them found out, I viewed myself and saw how disgusting I was and what I was doing was, and that because the \"hints\" were already given, there was no way back; I had to distance myself from the online life to not hurt my friends, or more correctly, not face the consequences of what I had done until then. I kept and still keep getting messages from them regularly trying to re-stabilize a relation. I also had to leave the girl I had fallen in love with online because I didn't want to \"hurt\" her, either.\n\nI tried to get back into real life; I really did. I kept getting bullied in high school through 8th grade by the same guy who did it last year, but I didn't want to annoy or hurt anyone anymore, so I just took it in. One day he crossed the line, and I had to get to the principal, tearing, in order for someone to finally hear what I actually thought. They decided to change one of us to another class and luckily decided it should be him. Then 9th grade came in, and even though I've had a few breakdowns throughout the first trimester and still repent to whatever my 7th and 8th grade self thought was okay, I just kept on trying to pass high school, unseen, with no relations at all outside of my family, and playing video games but without making any \"new\" friends, slowly turning my old self into what I now despise.\n\nNow I don't even know what I go to high school for anymore; sometimes I get specifically good grades, and other times I don't even know 50% of the exam's subject, not depending on the specific subject it is, just randomly. Last Tuesday I broke down and noticed just how bad my situation was, gathering whatever is left of \"bravery\" in me to post this. I'm sure nobody in my class minimally respects me or knows me well enough to have an opinion on me; the biggest conversation I've had with other classmates yesterday was, \"Have you studied?\" —\"No, just the basics,\" and today two people asked me what brand my phone was. That's it. That's all I communicate with other classmates daily and what I supposedly plan to keep on doing.\n\nI'm also almost sure, even though they don't know half of what I've passed through, my family, consisting of a divorced father who I just see every two weekends, a mother, and two brothers, is already starting to get tired of me. I really think about how the satisfaction of death might be all I need many times, every time, every day, and if it's worth it committing suicide at least once a day. It's not like I'm going to commit suicide anyway; there are people who have it worse than me, I don't want to leave a mess for my family, and even worse, I'm too much of a horrible and real coward to do it, at least by myself.\n\nEvery time I reach what's considered nothing for average people, I keep trying to hype myself up on it so I have some motivation to keep going and expect to eventually hype myself on something bigger and reach \"happiness.\". I fail again, and I keep failing. I normally play video games and make concepts out of them to unleash creativity as a hobby; not like those concepts are getting out of my notes anytime soon anyway. Lately, I've started to stress on video games more than usual, and I keep on leaving; it's not even fun anymore. And if I stop playing, what do I have to make a concept on now?\n\nPeople had also known me to be \"good\" at drawing, even though there was always someone who could do it better than me. I just don't draw anymore and keep on telling people that I just draw \"from time to time\" to keep them convinced that there's still something minimally special about myself to be interested in. It's true, sometimes I do little drawings, horrible-looking anyways, and I always would rather just not make them.\n\nI really don't have a \"favorite\" subject; I just have a \"less life-sucking and stressful\" lot of subjects. English, as you can see, is an example. I still feel like I'm dead inside and want to die on the outside while in English class like in any other, but not as much, and I pretty much enjoy the English language more than any of my classmates. I really don't know what one of my classmates would tell you about me if you asked, \"He's just there,\" I guess, but numerous of the breakdowns I've had lately were inside the classroom, even seen by the first girl I wrongly asked out in 7th grade that I still like, but I won't commit the mistake of even talking to again. Ever.\n\nI really don't know what could be done to fix me. I just really don't. I've been to the psychologist a few times; I haven't told anything of this anyway; I just have kept on acting like I'm fine and nothing is wrong. I am 14 years old, and as of now, I still sleep with my loving and caring mother because sleeping in the same room in which the brother who hit me counted times during my childhood also sleeps in is frightening for me, and my mother doesn't want me to sleep on the couch, even if I want to sometimes.\n\nI'm only 14 and already feel like a walking shell of what I could have been if I didn't ruin it all over love and short satisfactions every time. As I said, I just don't find motivation anymore; I'm starting to hate my hobbies, the thought of my past self still disgusts me, the girl who I would have liked to spend my life with probably sees me as a weird guy, a pervert, or even hates me, my classmates don't even know me, and I can't share any of this with anybody outside of this where I can maintain my anonymity and stop shaming myself publicly.",

    "title": "Question for those with many years of depression (on/off) - has it gotten worse?",
    "selftext": "I'm 62, first depression as a teen.  Worst symptom to me, losing interest in everything.  \"Normally\" I find almost everything interesting.  I'll learn/research almost any subject, learn a new skill/hobby.  I've always been good at keeping myself entertained (and not by watching tv), but have periods where I don't care about anything, enjoy anything.   I have other symptoms, which generally come first, and others tend to notice (negative, moody, withdrawn, etc).  \n\nTook anti-depressants 1st at age 24 (desipramine).  On that for 9 months, with counseling and was good for years.  I learned ways to \"get myself out \" of the hole of depression, but often need medication.  Have been in counseling on/off since age 24, and \"on\" for the last 20+ years.   Unfortunately the therapist I loved died 2 years ago, current is \"better than nothing\".  I've been on Wellbutrin since age 30 (unclear what that is helping), without it I get argumentative, impatient and moody.   When I got stuck in a depressive period, I'd go on another med (along with Wellbutrin if seeing a pyschiatrist).   Different ones have helped, but not all.  The longest I was ever on one was a year.  Once I was better, I'd go off and continue to be fine.  \n\nI had a very bad and long-lasting depression starting in 2014, which got terrible in 2016 (and started abusing alcohol).  I was unable to find a pyschiatrist until 2018, but tried anti-depressants from primary (didn't work).  In 2018, the pyschiatrist I found did ketamine therapy, which was a miracle.  I also took lexipro.  When I was fine, and I'd been on lexipro a year, I didn't understand why I was told to keep taking them ... other than my history of getting depressed again-and-again (though with years of being great between).  But I got depressed again a year after ketamine (despite being on lexipro), and a ketamine booster helped.  \n\nANYWAY - I haven't felt FINE for any extended period since that first series of ketamine treatments in 2018.  I've been doing IM ketamine about every 4 months, but start to go downhill about a month after the treatment.  \n\nI'm trying to make sense of things.  I feel like I'm not at all the person I once was.  People can't depend on me for anything, my work performance is horrible (so work little and in process of retiring - which is in itself depressing).    I use the little energy I have to try to be \"pleasant\" so I'm not too miserable to be around.  But have trouble getting out of bed, showering, etc.  I enjoy nothing.  Not abusing alcohol is a struggle - I've been successful the past couple years, but part of me wonders WHY BOTHER?  I know alcohol does no good, only makes things worse, so that isnt really a problem (the desire is just a symptom of feeling miserable).  \n\nCould age be a factor??   The roller coaster of becoming depressed so quickly after ketamine has gotten me kind of giving up hope.  I tell myself I can't kill myself (my step daughter did this, and I know the effect it has on loved ones), that I \"shouldn't\", yet the craving for death is huge.  Fortunately praying for death doesn't work.  It's been 7 weeks since last ketamine, waiting for call-back to schedule another.  When I get obsessed with suicide, I figure I have to throw money at the problem.\n\nI also have low-thyroid which I started being treated for in 2019.  Made me wonder if that was part of the problem earlier, and if it's part of the problem now (I've read the range of \"normal\" is wide, and mine could still be low).  \n\nNot like there is any doctor that can really look into everything.  Feel like I need to figure this out, which I've been trying since 2021 (mostly during periods when I'm doing well).  \n\nAnyone else with many years of depressive history, but long periods of doing well?   And then got stuck in \"at best ok, usually bad, sometimes horrible\" for MANY years (10 for me at this point) ?  \n\nAny suggestions?  At this point I'm just working on making life tolerable, otherwise it seems SO unfair to have to live like this, just so my loved ones don't have the pain of my suicide. \n\nThanks\n\n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I'm 24, a trans dude, asexual, biromantic, and I live in a conservative state in the US where I'm watching fascism rise. I'm diagnosed with bipolar, autism, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, and worst of all Borderline Personality Disorder. That last diagnosis is the worst curse that's been put upon me, because it sets me so far apart from anyone else and makes it extremely difficult for me to maintain close relationships long term. I also tend to end up with really trashy, abusive people.\n\nLast year, I cut off my parents who abused me in childhood and condemned me when I came out as transgender. In fact, I ended up cutting off almost my entire biological family. I got cousins who'd probably love to see all the trans people like me die. I miss my mom the most. I also really miss my baby cousins. I love kids, I get along with them better than with most grown-ups. I still have a lot of energy so I'm able to match theirs. Someday I want to adopt and be a father of my own, once I meet a long-term partner to do that with.\n\n Just a week prior to cutting my family off,  my girlfriend broke up with me. I thought she was THE one. I saw our whole future together planned out. She was the most stable thing in my life. With the 2024 Election and plans already set to estrange my parents coming up, I still felt like everything was gonna be okay as long as she and I stuck together. She had substance abuse issues and was often emotionally neglectful or straight up mean or manipulative towards me. She's even pressured me into sexual acts but I did it anyway because I loved her and wanted to make her happy. I put up with it. I loved to take care of her, even though she never wanted to return the favor and would emotionally shut down / break down if I reached out for her support. She was very severely abused in childhood and has been through some of the worst most traumatic experiences ever. I don't even think I know the full of it because she hated talking about it, but I knew she had it rough. She loved her cat, art, video games, reading, and listening to the same 3 Helluva Boss songs over and over and over again (which was adorably annoying at times). She was soo soft and in the beginning of our relationship she was very sweet, affectionate, and considerate and she wanted to be around me all the time, which I reciprocated. She started asking for more and more space and stopped seeming so happy to see me over time, gradually pushing me away more and more each time I tried to call her out whenever she did or said something that hurt me. She wasn't one to apologize unless you begged for an apology, even though sometimes all I wanted to hear was her saying she was sorry. She'd feel guilty but she usually just shut down, sometimes having severe panic attacks, or she'd hit me back with something I did wrong instead. And I admit I did have plenty of fuck ups in the relationship, primarily that I was too dependent on her. For the longest time I refused to validate myself so I found it in somebody else instead, such as her. I didn't feel like I deserved to show up for myself, not when I've hurt people in the past. So, often when I attempted to confront her when she hurt me, it ended with me apologizing instead, asking her how I can be better and typically receiving no answer or a very vague answer. And yet, I was so in love with her, genuinely more than I've ever loved anyone else. I saw her potential and thought that she just needed somebody to support her and really care about her to help her see it and get better. Because behind all of this she's a kind, talented, funny, loving, amazing person worthy of all the good things in the world. The breakup destroyed me. It's been 6 months since the breakup, we were only together for 3 months, yet I still miss her like hell. I recently met a very handsome guy with ALL green flags and I like him, but it doesn't feel right dating again while I'm still in this headspace. Not when people are still pointing out how I talk about this woman ALL THE DAMN TIME. I practically worshipped her, she was a goddess to me, and it's really difficult to just ctrl -> undo all of that.\n\nNot long after I cut off my parents, both of their dogs died. One of them was old and expected to die soon but I still thought I had more time. The other dog was one of my dearest friends and she was expected to live for many more years but they found out she had brain cancer too late. She was a fat dog, lost a lot of weight, and the vets decided this was a good thing even though every time i visited I was getting more and more concerned. She looked freakishly thin, almost sickly. My parents kept taking her for check ups and the vets kept saying it's fine. I guess fatphobia killed the dog, too... And I want to come back to my biological family one day, when they're ready. I wanted to be there for the death of their dogs, especially the younger one who I was very attached to. I miss my mom. I used to lash out at her in anger when really the person I was angry with was my dad but it was safer to lash out at my mom. I know my dad's said and possibly done some fucked up things to my mom, too. She's been through too much. I feel like she married the wrong man, and that she would've been a better person with a happier life if she had chosen differently for her marriage or maybe waited a bit longer before marrying and having kids. And I miss my dog. She was so sweet and cuddly and I'll never get to pet her or snuggle her ever again. I'll never hear her snorting, sneezing, farting, eating. She's gone. I didn't even get to say goodbye.\n\nLast semester I started going back to school full-time and I started HRT. I felt like I was finally becoming myself, building a life for myself that was worth living, and I even made my first real best friends in so long!! I was also going out to queer events, where I met my chosen dad. And I was living in a Housing Coop (not a student one, I'm actually the youngest person in the house) so I had company at home, too. It was very refreshing after feeling lost and isolated for several years.\n\nAnd then the 2024 Presidential Election happened. Trump won, and Project 2025 is turning into a reality. I was going to legally change my name and gender and now I can't. I'm scared that HRT will be taken from me. I'm scared of a lot of things being taken from me and from others in this world. And hearing people say \"I'm scared too\" is honestly not helping, I'm so overwhelmed by all that's happening or about to happen to all of us. A couple years ago I was very dissociated. I had poor memory, poor time management, lacked motivation and emotional regulation, and constantly contemplated suicide. I had even made a plan on a specific date to kill myself, but decided not to go through with it, thinking that things were gonna get better, and they did get better for a while. Even now things are better than they were then, because at least I'm finally out as transgender, asexual, and biromantic and now I get to unleash all of my queer art to the world (I'm a Creative Writing major and love to write short stories, poems, and I'm making a novel)- even if the political climate has became very scary, my parents scared me more. I started lacking in school and this semester I had to drop all but one of my classes.\n\nI started breaking down and my therapist advised me to lean onto my new best friends for support. I knew what was gonna happen. The moment I open up to somebody, a flood rushes out and I overwhelm them. There's just SO much I'm dealing with, and like I said earlier I was depending on others too much for validation. I expected too much from my friends, and they left me too. I don't need pity for this- It was all my fault, I fucked up and said some things that were very hurtful to them. I accept that losing them is a fair consequence for my actions, and that they didn't owe me forgiveness even when I realized what I had done and apologized. I fully trust that I would've been a better friend to them had they forgiven me, but they didn't and that's out of my control. When I think positively, though, I understand now why friendship is important, what a healthy friendship is meant to look like, and maybe one day I'll find that with somebody else. But for now, I'm burdened with the guilt and shame of my actions, and reminded of it regularly when I see any of them on campus.\n\nI still had my chosen dad. But he's gone MIA for a couple weeks now. The last few times I heard from him during the months prior, he was struggling and he'd get a little better and then he'd get worse again. Hopefully he's just in a hospital and his phone is off but I don't know. He could have killed himself. I don't know his address because he always came to me, and I don't have contact with anyone else who knows him. I attempted to reach out to some of his Facebook Friends, but I never use Facebook anymore and my account has no posts, no pfp, and is under a fake name for privacy from my biological family. So, they probably thought I was a bot because they ignored me. I tried calling 911 for a wellness check and they said no since I don't know his address. I tried filing a missing person's report but they once again said no because I need to contact all the local hospitals first, and they can't tell me if he's in their facilities because of HIPAA laws, plus where we live there are a LOT of hospitals he could be at. So, it's a lost cause, my chosen dad could be dead or in danger and I have no idea and there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nAnd for the cherry on top, I have been abused by several of my roommates, so now I have to move again. I have lost all faith in people and even in myself. I can't get close to people anymore. I crave connection but I also don't want to get close to people anymore. It only opens up for us to hurt each other. So, I'm trying to be my own best friend. I'm trying to learn how to validate myself and make myself happy and fulfilled. And maybe one day, I'll be able to be close to people again. It helps, but it takes an incredible amount of strength and I just don't have that every day. I'm working very hard to stop feeling lonely by myself. But at times it feels impossible. Especially with the state of the world we're in right now. I'm poor. I can't afford the mental hospital. I can barely even afford therapy. I definitely can't afford top surgery so I wear my binder all day, every day which I figure is whatever since I only really get some mild back/neck pain from it, I've even worked out in my binder and I work in my binder lifting heavy objects too. I don't care. I need a flatter chest. Sadly my binder doesn't even make me flat enough to be cis passing. But I try everything I can for customers to stop calling me \"ma'am\" every day. I swear to god, I want to hit somebody when they call me \"ma'am\" or \"miss.\" My voice is gradually deepening and I'm growing a fucking mustache for fuck's sake. I bind and I pack. My nametag displays a guy's name. It's fucking OBVIOUS. It especially hurt today when a guy called me \"ma'am\" minutes after I thought up another suicide plan (which I don't want to go through with, I don't want to kill myself, I just wish I was never born). \n\nAnd side note, I'm so tired of all these queer/trans feel-good stories. They only make me feel worse. Ever notice that in most of those stories people have friends or family or SOMEONE to support them? Ever notice they were able to attain at least one surgery that they wanted? Ever notice that they probably don't possess a Cluster B Personality Disorder?? Yeah cool I guess, wish I had that, but since I don't it only makes me feel even more hopeless. I mean I am happy for their happiness, really, but that's just not my story and I don't know if it ever will be.\n\n  \nI've been severely depressed and anxious since childhood. I've heard SOOOO MANY FUCKING TIMES about how \"it gets better\" but IT DOESN'T. Things just keep getting WORSE!!! I probably even have concussions now from how many times I've hit my head on floors, doors, furniture, etc as forms of self harm. I started doing that when I was 17 because it scared my dad out of screaming at me and cursing me out after all my other defense tactics were used up. Speaking of which my head is pounding right now as I type this. My heart is racing. My vision is going blurry. Work scheduled me to work last night then come back super early this morning so I'm lacking sleep and that definitely doesn't help. But I still need to be picking up more hours so I can keep affording food and shelter ahahahahaha yayyy capitalism amiright? Two jobs and I still can't afford more than $500 of rent, what a life!! America is so great and it's only getting greater huh? I'm so fucking sick of it all.\n\nI miss my dogs. I miss my girlfriend. I miss my best friends. I miss my chosen dad. I want them back.\n\nTLDR; \n\nI'm trying very very hard working with myself, my therapist, and my psychiatrist to be happy on my own without any kind of outside support system. But some days I just don't have the strength. Please, if you're willing and able, can you help me by commenting with reasons to keep going, even just for one more day?",

I reluctantly told my parents I'm depressed 1.5 years ago and i regret telling them. \n\nThey don't understand somehow, I don't get how they dont as they have both been depressed before but.. My mom doesn't understand how hard it is for me to do simple things, she just thinks im lazy, she doesn't get how much energy it takes for me to go wash my hair, do the dishes, eat a proper meal, clean my room, etc. Every now and then when im having an especially bad day I can't hold myself from crying in front of them. It always ends up worse that before though. My dad doesn't know how to listen without telling me how good i have it and how other people in the world dont. But my mom is blunt and has told me to stop complaining or she tells me what to do and when i tell her i just want her to listen and not give me suggestions she doesnt take it well. \n\na month ago i was telling her (crying too) about how i hate high school and don't really like/ relate to my friends she told me that i need to invite my friends around more (dumb suggestion if i just told u i dont like them) and told me to stop complaining if i wasnt gonna do that. i didnt want to talk to her after that. \n\nA couple months ago i was having one of those cry sessions and accidentaly said i dont want to be here anymore so my mom took me to a nurse the next day (the one good thing shes done) and it was good i liked the nurse and saw her 2 more times but i wasnt allowed to see her again and had to go to another person as she wasnt a proper therapist. 3 people later i didnt like the third person, saw her twice but decided i didnt want to tell my life story to her. Told my mom that on the way back and she didnt respect my decision, told my dad and he came in to try and talk me into going back to her and asked me why i dont open up more. So, I did. I told him \"I just want to die\" and he reacted really bad, im not planning anything but if i was i think that wouldve pushed me over the edge. He said \"Why would you say that to someone who's sister did that and to a guy whos father is terminal and would kill to live your life\" that made me really mad because I feel like he made me feel guilty for feeling the way i feel after he had just told me to open up more. this was like a week ago and i still havent forgiven him. he apologised reluctantly straight after when i was angry at him but idk i still dont want to talk to him. \n\nNow my parents are all in my business. I was gonna book a appointment with the school counsellor and did today but on the car ride home my mom got angry with me when i didnt want to talk to her about booking an appointment and tbh i blocked it out but i remember it made me feel shit. Any advice on how to deal with them would be helpful thanks.",

    "selftext": "I'm 17 (M) and I've been depressed for months now.\n\nI'm in my senior year of high school and I hate my life. I'm stressed a lot about my social life.\n\nBefore and at the start of high school, I was part of a friend group. It was one of the best times of my life. I felt understood, we had a lot in common, and there would rarely be dull moments. We would have the funniest times ever and enjoy each other's company. It was the only time in my life I ever felt like I belonged anywhere. But ever since high school started, I became more distant from them. I still found reasons to not be with them.\n\nSince it was freshmen year, everyone was trying to talk to new people and I did feel a little left out when I would hang out with this group of friends. So I stopped hanging out with them for a bit and started hanging out with this one friend from middle school that I knew for a while (let's call him Jack). I now completely began hanging out with Jack and his friends, which was now my new friend group, but I always had a feeling that this group of friends were losers and that I should be hanging out with my old group of friends that I would have fun with.\n\nNear the end of sophomore year, my mental health deteriorated so badly. I would always ask Jack to go to the movies or hang out but he would always come up with an excuse not to come. The other friends wouldn't text me during the summer, they were just school friends. My family would always ask me why I don't go out or hang out with anyone but I had no one.\n\nI didn't like hanging out with Jack and my other old friends. They were quite literally losers. They were boring and had no humour or interests, and I wanted to hang out with my old group of friends. My old group of friends were so much more fun. They just seemed a lot cooler and fun to be around. They also talked to girls and I know I'd have a lot of fun if I was with them. This current group of friends I was hanging out with at school didn't talk to any girls which is fine but some of them would be so awkward around girls.\n\nI feel like hanging out with them has also made me a boring person. I've never had a girlfriend and I blame these friends because I know for a fact I would have had a girl if I was hanging out with my old friends, they would talk to others and be more outgoing and social and I definitely would have met a girl through them. I felt so isolated and lonely last summer, I was doing nothing every day and had no one to talk to.\n\nI'm now in my senior year, I have no one else to hang out with and nowhere else to go so I have to hang out with them at school and at lunch. Jack is my only friend out of them and the other ones don't consider me their friend. I don't consider them my friends either, I'm only friends with them because they're Jack's friends. I also feel like Jack has gotten more closer to them. I feel like my siblings would be disappointed looking at the group of friends I'm hanging out with because they're quite literally losers.\n\nWhen I look at my sibling's friends, they're so much more funnier and cooler. The people I'm hanging out with are the most boring and have no energy. I miss my old group of friends because they're so much more fun. They're also funny. They have a lot to talk about and I would enjoy being around them. But I feel like I can't hang out with them anymore and that it's too late. Because it's been established that I hang out with Jack and these other \"friends\". And going back to my old group of friends would be a little weird and awkward.\n\nI hate this group of friends I hang out with now as I think they're holding me back from my potential. They're losers. I need advice on what I can do.",

    "selftext": "Hello, \n\nI am reaching out because I need all the help and positivity I can now. Long story short, I am diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety. My psychiatrist is trying to figure out if I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder as well. I am also in recovery and attend AA.  I have been dealing with different degrees of depression/anxiety for my whole life. I have been on so many medications over the years that I couldn't even name all of them. Some helped, some gave me horrible side effects and I had to discontinue them, and some just seemed to quit working after some time. I also want to add that I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I also practice coping skills and reach out for other support when I am not completely incapacitated and sleeping all day. \n\nMy main reason for posting is because I am currently in a horrible depressive episode and having suicidal ideation thoughts. I don't want to end my life, but I don't want to live like this anymore. I feel like I tried everything and nothing is helping me. I feel hopeless, defeated, sad, lonely, and like no one understands. I have panic attacks in the morning when I have to get up to teach (I teach English online as a second language from home). I have had to cancel so many classes that my contract will probably be reviewed and I may lose my job. I also have another part-time job working from home but had to take a leave of absence. I have to decide if I am going to start working that job again because I need to financially, but I feel like I can't emotionally handle it. I am having a lot of difficulty just doing the basics of daily living, like showering, eating, and not staying in bed all day. All I want to do is sleep. I am a very clean person, but I have not taken a shower for a week and it seems impossible to get one. I have no energy physically and feel completely drained mentally. I am a very spiritual person and pray to God, but I am not feeling the close connection that I used to. I feel like God even gave up on me at times. I feel alone, even though I have so many supportive people in my life, but I only feel like a burden to them. I don't feel I bring anything good to anyone close to me or the world. \n\nI have never attempted suicide, but I have struggled with suicidal ideation at times (not all of the time), but it is really bad right now. I woke up today and just sat on my bathroom floor and cried. I keep getting intrusive thoughts of hurting myself. I try to use coping skills and reach out for support, but sometimes it feels like the negative thoughts and depression/anxiety are so strong I can't fight back. I feel like I don't have any more fight left. I am terrified because I don't want these suicidal ideations to lead to something bad. This time, it just feels different. I feel like I just want to cut myself or hurt myself to release some of the physical pain. I have never cut myself before, but I understand now why people do it. I just don't want to live like this anymore but I want to still live. I don't know how to deal with all of this. If anyone can help me, I would appreciate it. \n\nI want to say I do have a psychiatrist and therapy appointment in a couple of days. They are aware I have been struggling with all of these things. My psychiatrist and I decided to try a new medication, Vraylar. I took this medication before and ended up with extreme involuntary muscle movements. My psychiatrist and I decided to start with a very low dose and add Cogentin to help with the muscle movements. I am praying that this works. Please pray for me that this medication helps me and that I don't have those side effects. Thanks for anyone who reads this. I wish you all the best. :)\n\n",

    "selftext": "First time posting and I just kinda wanted to say how I be feeling. This week has been rough for me mentally. On Monday, I (19 M) had to deal with my best friends girlfriend who kept molesting my food at Applebees; she was tossing ice cubes into my drinking cup with her nasty, unwashed, bloodied up hand, and she smeared food on my arm (I am a huge germaphobe, especially around food). Then after Applebees, I got mad at my buddy for defending her actions and laughing at me while she was doing it. After that had to deal with my buddy who got alcohol poisoning and was throwing up all over himself and his sleeping arrangement (his sister’s couch). I was so worried for him and stayed up till stupid o’clock in the morning till he fell asleep and was breathing normally. The next day was alright, can’t remember what all happened. Wednesday, I fell way behind in my CDL homework and had to finish it all by midnight. I did it but I had to skip Soc class. Thursday my mom went off to my sister’s wrestling meet so I had the house to myself. I cleaned up the house and made it look nice to have friends over. It started off alright but my one of my friends started getting a little aggressive (he’s a little, well, a lot unaware of his own tone and actions). Then my choir buddy starts touching up on me like all the guys in choir do which makes me super uncomfortable but I just take it. And my other friends who were there were alright (also choir friends). It was a meh night. Friday, I tried to have another little party at my house, and then I realized I don’t have a whole lot of friends I can hangout with and party with whose company I truly enjoy. A few of my buddies came over. One of them was drunk off his ass when he came (the same friend from Monday whom I had to baby sit) and my other buddy was just as unimpressed as I was. It took us about an hour to try and get him home and he only lived 2 blocks down from me. Another kinda meh night. Yesterday, got woken up by my friend who needed help moving chickens from her grandparents farm to hers. Spent all my day doing that and when I got my home, my buddies girlfriend calls me up and asks if I wanted to get something to eat. I thought she was going to apologize for being a bitch on Monday (cause she most certainly was) and said food was on her (note she also owes me $40). So I get there and she starts going in about how this dinner is coming out of the money she owes me, even though she said it was on her. I’m pretty upset about it cause I can’t believe people think that that is okay. At the time of writing, my brain is just processing the other things going on in my life. I have to apply for a lineman school in Texas very soon or else I might not get in, but I can’t seem to get myself to do it. Idk why, and I really want to, but I’m scared man. I don’t have a job right now and all my friends and peers are judging and berating me for it. I’m in college and I am fine with getting with what I have selling used tvs to other kids on campus and doing freelance work for friends and family, but the pressure and the feeling of failure put onto me by my peers for not having a job is tearing me up. I don’t have a girlfriend and I feel so alone with myself. I just want someone who I can cuddle with, watch movies, and feel loved, and I want someone to feel that same way with me. I want a romantic connection with someone, and not even sex (I’ve waited 19 years, what’s another couple years), but a real romantic connection, but, I just keep fumbling every amazing girl that’s comes into my life. And my mother, she wants me to have the next 10 years of my life figured out right now it feels like, but idk what I’m going to do in 10 years, I don’t even know what’s I’m doing tomorrow and it feels like a lot, but I don’t think it’s a lot. I think I need something more in my life but I don’t want more stuff in my life. My mom packs her schedule with every excuse to work she can, and she is a narcissistic alcoholic (she isn’t that that bad but she’s still got a lot of quirks). I got some minor self deleting thoughts but nothing I would act upon. I could walk over to my closet, grab a cordless hole puncher, and take a ride on the sewer slide, but I never would, cause this is the only life I get and I can’t trick myself into thinking of anything beyond the grave that would save my soul, so I want to live this life. But those thoughts just stick with me, and I don’t appreciate it 😭. I just feel like a hunk of shit floating through the world. I’m also highly self conscious. Anything I say or do I think I do wrong, and anything I do isn’t good enough cause I feel stupid and unworthy. Or sometimes I feel too good for other people, but then I feel like an asshole who judges people based on their own problems. Idk what I think of myself or those around me. I hang around with a lot of lgbtq people, and I, a cis man, will be hanging out with them and all of a sudden they go on a tangent about how all cis men need to be eradicated, transitioned, or castrated. It really hurts to hear that from the people you take comfort in. \n\nTLDR: silly brain think that people suck, he sucks, want to die but doesn’t, doesn’t feel loved, doesn’t feel accomplished or appreciated, and feels like a hunk of shit?\n\n(I apologize for any grammatical mistakes or random thought jumps I wrote this in one take and didn’t look back on what I already typed. Imma just say fuck it and send it. Any advice or conversation would be awesome. I really just wanted to throw that  all out there somewhere cause I’ve been bottling it up for a while)\n\n(Edit: I’ve also been diagnosed with PDD and Anxiety)",

My bills continue to rise yet I can't seem to find ANY jobs that pay a livable wage, let alone jobs in my desired field. I have over 20 years of customer service experience, most of that was as some kind of supervisor or manager. I've worked as a bartender, a bar manager, a server, barista, and still, I can't find anything.\n\nI've always had a lot of friends. But over the years, we've either grown apart, or I've realized they weren't healthy for me, or they move on with their lives and move away. I only have one friend in town now, but they work so much that we've only seen each other once in 18 months.\n\nI don't recognize the person in the mirror anymore. This wasn't the life I imagined for myself. I'm questioning every decision I've made that got me here, wondering where I went wrong. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I quit smoking pot, I'm painfully sober, realizing that life just fucking sucks all the time. I don't have anyone to talk to for support. I'm afraid to be real with anyone about my life because it sounds so depressing EVERY TIME I share what's going on that I feel like I'm begging for sympathy. I see the pity in their eyes, I hear it in their voice, and it kills me.\n\nI wake up every day looking toward the positive, telling myself that this is only temporary, that something has got to give eventually and things will get better soon. I tell myself that I am lovable and worth dating. I tell myself that all I have to do is keep my head up and keep trying. With every rejection email, that light dims more and more. I'm running out of positive affirmations I can believe.\n\nI find myself with that pain in the back of my throat, holding back tears realizing this is my reality. I can't kill myself, my younger brother already did that when I was a teenager. I couldn't hurt my family that way after I saw and felt what it did to those that are still living.\n\nThinking about the ways life as we know it will change with the new administration taking office takes my anxiety over the edge. My family lives off of social security, medicaid, and food stamps to get by. I'm the only one capable of working and thinking about what could happen, or what I might have to do to get my family what they need...I just can't. I feel like this will by my life until I die.\n\nI had to get this off my chest. I don't want your advice. I don't want your pity. I just wanted to say it in the hopes that someone else going through something like my experience knows they're not alone.",

I have been in a very happy, loving relationship for almost two years now, but we have had emotionally and verbally explosive arguments along the way, usually stemming from my boyfriend’s over defensiveness and sensitivity and my easily triggered brain from growing up in a belligerent household. The friends I made along the way either ended up being insecure and jealous/hateful towards me or really simply never gave a damn about me, taking my kindness and naivety as weakness instead. I have no definitive passions in life, still working towards finding what *it* is. I teeter on breaking up with my boyfriend and wanting to be alone. People will say I am the problem if I keep finding myself in confrontational situations and not getting along with family, “friends,” relationships, so I started therapy about 6 months ago. I find that no matter what approach I take, even if gentler, people will always want to be argumentative or combative with me, as though they feel I am not worthy of their full respect. This has caused me to feel low self worth for many years and even suicidal thoughts, which is why I sought therapy.\n\nI can only do my best, but it seems people only ever want to unload their aggressions unto me no matter what and it makes me think about being alone entirely - no family, no friends, no partner, nothing. The world does not seem to be accepting of me and I am too much of an empath that being emotionally and mentally strong seems impossible. Call it drastic, call it dramatic, but these are my regular interactions and it has become emotionally and mentally draining, I just feel like being completely alone would bring me a sense of undisputed peace. My therapist tells me humans need connection, but I feel like connection only ever causes me harm … does anyone else feel this way?",

    "selftext": "I (M26) am feeling stuck, more so than probably any point in my life. I was orphaned as a baby and never met my biological family. I didn't know about this until I was 21 although the people who raised me claimed they told me years ago as a child though I have no memory of this. My childhood was neglectful, abusive, toxic and overall unhappy due to my narcissistic \"parents\" who raised me to replace a child they lost in a miscarriage. By the time I was 16 I was depressed though no one noticed or cared enough to do anything. Things were exacerbated when my grandma (Non-Biological) passed away and the family fell into even more dysfunction (Long story for another post) I went to college to get away from this family and have freedom I'd never had which caused me to flunk out within 2 Years. After that I bounced around minimum wage jobs and blew my money on getting high to distract myself from my problems and not kill myself. I eventually became homeless for 3 years and came as close as I ever have to ending it, but somehow I pulled through and now am sheltered again with the best paying job I've ever had though still low wage. I now have some sense of normalcy I've tried to improve myself in small ways like eating more vegetables, researching personal finance/financial literacy, and learning to save money. By almost any account I'm doing leaps and bounds better than I have been the last few years and yet I feel as empty and depressed as ever.\n\n I'm anxious all the time, I procrastinate far too much, I have no drive or discipline, I'm always in a s*** mood, I have very little patience for people in an scenario even if there's no real reason for me to be annoyed. I make up fantasies in my head to escape reality, I smoke weed any chance I get and it's the only time I feel anything other than sadness or anger. I have things I would like to do and ways I'd like to improve but can never seem to get myself to commit to anything. I know I need to be better but I don't know how and can't seem to change, but things really became clear when I found myself starting to drink more and more (which is something that's never been my thing). Even to the point where I would drink at work, to get through my shift. I've already had a meeting with management about my behavior and know I need to change. How do I turn my life around? It feels like I'm heading down a dark path to nowhere that will either harm myself or others. I want to make more money, be healthy, be content with life, not go everyday wishing I wasn't born, have friends, have hobbies and overall just function at a level I'm capable of because it feels like I've never lived up to my capabilities if that makes sense. IDK what I'm asking or if this even makes sense and I have more I could add but I just feel stuck I guess. ",

Then I could create an itinerary of everything I want to do before going to sleep forever and saying goodbye to the cruelty I experienced living as a slave in corporate America surrounded by a society where everything is broken shattered glass and everyone is forced to walk in it, shower in it, eat it. Every day is pain and every person is poison. They successfully brainwashed nearly everyone. Sometimes I wish I was blessed with ignorance. The least I could do is try to live life in the way that I wish things could be in my final days on this earth. I would not want to be attached to anyone. I could distance myself from everyone and then just disappear. I would like for my things to go to my nieces and be passed on to other little girls as the family grows and people age. I wish for whatever money I may have left to be perhaps placed in a Roth IRA or something and used toward their education.   \n  \nI hate that I want to die. I’ve never felt it this strongly before. I’ve never actually pictured myself doing it until today. It was a waking thought that I was oddly at peace with and even happy about. In my dream I was put to sleep, but it was still a dream. It didn’t feel like a nightmare. Now it scares me and upsets me at the same time that feeling like I was going to end my life voluntarily actually made me feel better. I was looking around at everyone sitting by me at lunch- listening to their conversations. It felt different. I was seeing people who would still be here after I was gone instead of seeing my coworkers. Are all gatherings going to feel like silent goodbyes now? Clearly, I’m a problem. I’m a fuck up and a waste of time, space and effort. Even the people who say they love me can’t stand me. The world keeps spinning. People would forget about me. Especially if I distance myself first. Maybe some could live their life just wondering where I am.\n\nMaybe if I’m lucky and the world has a fortunate twist of events leading to a place where love takes precedence above everything else,  my spirit could fill another vessel and I could experience what being loved feels like. If love, respect and kindness are ever valued above all else worldwide… imagine how beautiful life would be.",

We lived together, had a cat together, did everything together. I drove her everywhere she wanted to go. I thought everything was perfect. I made some mistakes in the time we dated. We dated for 3 years and I was freshly 20 when we started. I made some mistakes, didn't take her seriously when she said I had to change, didn't get help for my ADHD or depression. We would have a big fight about once a month and I didn't know how to talk about my feelings so I would hurt her emotionally. Well on a Friday in September she said she had been feeling a certain way and wanted to talk about it. We talked a little bit I didn't think it was gonna be a huge deal. We had just had a great week. Our roommate was out of town and we had spent the week with each other, hanging out cuddling watching movies going on dates, that kinda stuff. Then our roommate, her best friend, got back in Saturday and they talked about it alone. Next thing I know Tuesday night I get home from game night and she's crying in our bed talking about how she's thinking about breaking up with me. I have work in the morning but I'm up till 5 crying and feeling hopeless. I go to work the next day and when I get home there is a bag packed for me and she says she's breaking up with me. I try to fight for us but she isn't having it. I move back in with my parents, eventually let her keep the cat. She says she isn't comfortable having me in her life. She says she needs at least 3 months no contact. That was the 21st of October she said that. I have until the 21st of January to wait to find out if she is willing to be friends. She saved me when we first started talking. He started talking to me in August of 2021 in July I had decided to kill myself. She saved my life. And without her in it. I'm right back where I started. I am living at my parents again. I am going to work again. But that's it. I don't have any friends. I don't have any hobbies that aren't shared with her. All I do all the time is think about her and how much I miss her and how sorry I am. And frankly I can't go on without her. so for Christmas, I'm going to buy myself a gun. And depending on how January goes I might kill myself. I know everyone's going to say please don't but I can't go on without her. She is my soul. I've just got to prep some letters for my family and for her. I need everyone to know it's not their fault and that they did everything they could. And not to blame her.",

She went missing on Sunday, no one could find her, turned all her location services off. I spent that time out looking for her. Police did end up finding her early Tuesday morning. Police were told she's sober, so if they find her and she's drunk she's going to hurt herself. Police found her drunk in a hotel room with a cup full of pills and left her there, not bothered, and lied to me upon her request that she wasn't drunk and they wouldn't tell me where she was. On Tuesday afternoon, she called me to go and take her to hospital because her attempt hadn't worked.\n\nI stayed with her in hospital until last night. Her liver is severely damaged and she may need to move to a city two hours away for a number of months to go to a transplant hospital. I don't drive. \n\nI am a mess. She is everything to me. I kept pulling doctors aside to ask if she was going to survive and they can't tell me. She was missing, I got her back, and I don't know if it's forever or not. I don't know what support is available to me. And then there are the practicalities - I don't know what to do. I have a little puppy and can't afford hotels near the city she may have to go to nor to board the puppy with her favourite sitter for much longer. She earns twice the amount I do and the house is all because of her. \n\nShe's saying she doesn't want to die, she's frightened, she wants to live now. I believe her. I'm going back to the hospital in half an hour and hopefully will find out what's next soon. Her parents are flying in from abroad where they live. I can't think straight. \n\nI think I'm posting here just because I need to talk about it a little bit and if anyone can help me find UK based support as I am not bereaved by suicide and that's all that's coming up.

    "selftext": "*My last post was very scattered, so I wanted to rewrite it more cohesively, albeit long.*\n\n**TW** ⚠️ brief mentions of Suicidal Thoughts, Self Harm, Violence & CSA/COCSA\n\nI’m not really sure how to move forward with mental health support. I feel like nothing is helping despite my efforts. \n\nI struggle with depression, and have experienced suicidal ideation every day since childhood, being in and out of therapy since my preteens, originally because of self harm. My mental health has affected most areas of my life. Now, at **22**, I’m not in work, or education, and struggle with most daily activities. \n\nBut, since I don’t know the ‘reason’ for feeling this way, I’m not really sure how to improve? \n\nTherapists and other professionals have often said I have C-PTSD or even suspected OSDD/DID, but I struggle to believe that is true. My memory of my childhood isn’t the most vivid, but I have foggy memories of being strangled by one of my parents, and multiple disjointed memories of sexual assault (outside of my family) during childhood, but I don’t really know how to trust any of these are real, despite the memories being there. This doubt makes it hard to pursue any additional trauma related support, because it feels like I’m taking resources that may not apply to me; or that I would be a bad person if it turns out to be false. \n\nRegardless, I feel like… even if I do exhibit trauma responses, there isn’t really anything that I can pinpoint or target therapeutically.\n\nFor example, if someone is hyper-vigilant due to trauma, they can retrain their brain to realise they’re safe. The issue is that I don’t really… feel as though I have anything similar to that, where a specific feeling, thought or experience can be connected to a particular event, so there isn’t anything for me to focus on learning, unlearning or healing from. \n\nI’ve attempted to explore my dissociation and “parts” but everything becomes increasingly more confusing when trying to make sense of those, and creates more doubt on next steps. \n\nOverall, this lack of direction in my mental health journey is making me feel really stuck. Currently, there is no path and no sign posts on how to find one… but I just really want to stop feeling this way, and to have a life that isn’t affected by my mental health, since I feel like I have lost so much of it’s potential already. \n\nI’m really uncertain on what to do, so any thoughts at all would be helpful. Even if you don’t have advice, thank you for reading, it’s comforting to feel like someone is listening! ❤️\n",

    "selftext": "I (18f) just started college a couple weeks ago and met this guy in my stem classes. I don’t get along with him very well but he told me he needed sometime to hang out with so I kind of just drove him around doing errands while he vented to me nonstop. \nHe has clung to me since then and has been getting more and more pushy and rude and trying to get me to do stuff I’m not comfortable with all while venting. I’ve been politely but firmly declining him since I need time to study and time to myself.\n\nThis morning after class I told him I had plans and he started talking about how he’s having to up his meds, that his friends all left him and that he’s going to end it all in a couple of days. I suggested that he check out clubs to talk to more people or use the campus resources and that I was in no way qualified to be talking with him about this and he just refuted everything that I said and continued on about how he can’t go on. I said that I was here if he wanted someone to listen but that I was not a good support source. I will say that I know what it’s like, I’ve been suicidal since I was a kid but I’ve been putting one foot in front of the other trying to make my life manageable. Even though I know how it is, I am by no means a therapist or even a good friend to vent to for a guy I’ve known for a few days.\n\nRegardless, I had to head out of town to run errands and would be out far into the evening— and since he told me he was seeing his psychiatrist I assumed he would take a breath and step back. He texted me in the middle of me being far away from campus that he couldn’t be alone and that he needed someone. I tried to be as considerate as possible when telling him I was nowhere near campus and told him to go into the gaming area of our campus just to be around others. I was so scared after that message that he would do something bad, and that it would be my fault for not being there. I made a very shaken call to campus security telling them that he wanted to kill himself to which they handled it. \n\nEven though my report was anonymous, he messaged me a few hours ago telling me he knew I reported it. I have class with him tomorrow and I don’t know what to do, I still have a full year of this ahead of me. I’m already dealing with so much as is, I was so hopeful I’d have a fresh start here to make good friends and I feel like I’ve screwed it all up.\n\nTL:DR a guy I just met threatened to end it and is now upset that I reported it. Im afraid to be around him now.",

    "selftext": "\nContent warning because I didn’t know what flair to use: self harm, suicidal thoughts, eating disorders\n\n\nHi. So basically to be frank I am going thru a lot rn. But I really don’t know. I have bad issues with worrying about being attention seeking, so I don’t really want to talk to anyone in real life about this apart from a psychiatrist eventually if that’s even viable. \n\nFor background, when I was a child I dissociated heavily (wasn’t diagnosed with anything, but I have limited memories of my childhood and my mother has mentioned having conversations with therapists about me “being in my own world” and based on that and my current tendency to dissociate at times, I’ve reached this conclusion). \n\nAs a teen I went holed up in my room all day doing nothing and having suicidal thoughts to eventually self harming, engaging in disordered eating behaviors, and I had at least two hypomanic episodes according to my therapist at the time, one of which had psychosis? Stuff happen? Idk how to word that. But basically I hallucinated police sirens and freaked out all of my friends lol. Poor behavior as an older teen all around. Horrible social and general anxiety. \n\nThe disordered eating stuck around. Had anxiety attacks. Was told I had adhd and got an adderall dependency (I took 150-170mg a day for a while) have been on and off numerous anxiety meds, depression meds. None but adderall helped. Most gave me a horrible side effect lol. \n\nToday, recently, I’ve been feeling like I have some sort of personality disorder. All of my friends insist that I’m autistic (though they say I’m not “very” autistic). I went thru a rough breakup and he says I’m mean and manipulative and I feel that he’s right. I always say things that I feel so justified in saying and then I’m drowning in guilt not even an hour later but I can’t make myself stop the next time. I’m not trying to just blame a mental health condition for my own shitty actions but I genuinely feel like I’ve changed or something. I didn’t used to be like that and I feel like I don’t have a good grip on myself. \n\nMy disordered eating thoughts, thoughts of self harm, suicidal thoughts have returned. I dissociate at times I think. Allowed myself to get fired from my job because my anxiety was so bad I couldn’t stand to go anymore. Sometimes I feel like I don’t have a good grip on reality. \n\nAbout 2 years ago I convinced myself I was pregnant and everything I saw was a “sign” of my pregnancy and that I was having a girl. But as soon as I took a test the thoughts left and idk if I’m being dramatic because wouldn’t they have persisted even in the face of a factual result, if I was being delusional? I’m very worried I’m being like histrionic or something I don’t have anyone to talk to. \n\nSometimes I feel like I might be falling into a hypomanic state and I get excited because it’s the happiest I’ve ever been and I sort of want to crash out and have people see that I’m not doing well but as of right now the consequences of crashing out keep me from doing so and makes the idea of letting myself lose control feel sort of performative or something. Idk I’m not explaining myself well. I hope someone reads this. \n\nI would really like help I want to feel okay. I was doing well for a while. Please if anyone has any ideas let me know. Or if anyone thinks I’m just being stupid even that would help too, I’m not trying to sound self deprecating but I’m worried I’m just in my own head too much. ",

I waited 2 and a half hours), there are the chairs full of patients waiting for their turn, but the chair directly in front of me was actually empty, so it looked like I was targeting the Hispanic girls... and then there is the TV.

    "title": "\"Voluntary\" Admissions to Inpatient at Psychiatric Wards + Placement",
    "selftext": "Okay, bear with me. When you are examined by a mental health professional in the ER, they will decide on whether or not you're safe to go home or you will need to go into inpatient. When they do decide that you're going into an inpatient facility, they, most of the time, give you the option to go \"voluntarily\" or \"involuntarily\".\n\nNow, as the majority of you know, \"involuntarily\" basically means you're going. Period. No discussion about it. Now, if you're being admitted \"voluntarily\", you still have to be transferred to an inpatient facility but the difference is that you sign a paper saying that you're willing to go. That's at least how it went from my experience in hospitals.\n\nNow, do you see the problem here? The word, \"voluntary\" according to Merriam-Webster, is \"**defined as proceeding from the will or from one's own choice or consent\"**. Notice the words \"free will\" and \"consent\". That means you can do something if you want to but you don't have to. However, if you're being admitted voluntary to a psychiatric unit, you still have to go and you can't just choose to be discharged from the hospital and go home.\n\nI'm not saying that they doctors should allow them to go home no matter the situation, and even I would wish they would've gave me the option to just go home no matter what when I was in the hospital because the psychiatric hospital can be a real hell depending on who's there and where you're being sent to so I get it. What I'm saying is that the name of the process should be changed. It should be changed to a different wording because a \"voluntary\" admission is misleading.\n\nALSO another thing I want to talk about is the experience inside psychiatric units. I've been in and out of my share of them and I just want to say that patients with less complex mental health struggles should not be placed with more complex and serious mental health struggles. For example, a suicidal patient with severe depression and anxiety should not be placed in the same unit with a poorly medicated patient with a serious case of schizoaffective disorder. \n\nExcuse me for all the yapping but I'm trying to think more logically here and I want to see what you guys think about my statements.",

I’ve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts in the past, and I’ve also had ongoing health issues since I was 18. I’ve seen multiple doctors, had a colonoscopy, and ton of other tests. everything always comes back fine except for Pcos diagnosis. A couple of doctors suggested my other symptoms might be stress-related, but it makes me feel like people think I’m faking things, which is really discouraging.\n\nOn top of that, since March 2025 new symptoms started and it’s wearing me down, for which labs showed nothing and they are now down new tests. \n\nWork has also been tough. I recently trained someone who ended up getting promoted over me. I still carry my own workload while helping them with theirs, and now others on the team come to me with questions, even though management said I “wasn’t ready” for a promotion. It’s left me feeling unmotivated and more depressed.\n\nCareer-wise, I’ve been trying to transition from compliance into tech, something I’m genuinely passionate about. I even got accepted into a program, but between financial stress, debt, and my full-time job, I barely have the time or energy to study.\n\nOn top of all of this, I also live with my immigrant parents and my little sister. I help support them financially and emotionally. My parents try to be supportive, but they’re older, one is disabled, and both don’t speak English, so a lot falls on me.

I was prescribed Olanzapine and continued after my discharge, but got off it because I couldn't study with the drowsiness and had exams. \n\nFrom 2020-2022 I was relatively stable; somewhere in 2021 I was diagnosed with hypomania and prescribed Abilify, but it made me have suicidal thoughts so I stopped. My second psychotic episode was early 2023, then I was formally diagnosed with bipolar 1. My parents were adamant that I not be hospitalised, so I recovered at home and was prescribed Olanzapine. \n\nFollowing this episode, I saw a private psychiatrist until mid-2024. During the time I saw him, I had a major depressive episode and was prescribed Rexulti, Sertraline, Olanzapine, and vortioxetine to treat it. The meds didn’t result in any noticeable improvement in my condition and it was a struggle to get through daily life, university, etc. \n\nOver the years to treat this condition I've tried lithium, Rexulti, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Abilify, vortioxetine and sertraline. All have either had no noticeable effect on the condition, or side effects which made me stop them (weight gain, grogginess, nausea, loss of appetite, blurry/double vision). The latest outpatient psychiatrist I saw (same hospital since 2019 admission) said given my history, there isn’t much else she can advise on the medical front. All the meds that worked made me feel flat/depressed. I’ve been unmedicated for most of 2020-2023 & mid 2024-2025. I’m in therapy, exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, and take 5-HTP, probiotics, and Omega-3 daily. I’ve made lifestyle adjustments to minimise alcohol & stressful environments, but I’ve been having frequent episodes (4/5 per month to the point of pre-psychosis symptoms last month). \n\nNow I’m on homeopathic meds which worked well for a friend with bipolar 1 who now experiences zero mood swings, but said the first 2 months she was more suicidal than usual. The past two weeks (mid-August to now) have been brutal; since starting these meds I’ve felt completely out of control and can’t even identify how I feel/how to help myself. Self-harm/suicidal thoughts have been at an all-time high and the things that usually help, don't. Two nights ago I had a theory that I was feeling this low since abstaining from sex for roughly the same two-week period that I was on the new meds, so my boyfriend and I had sex and my mood improved + thoughts were clearer. Yesterday morning (day after we had sex), the homeopathic doctor said to take the meds every hour instead of 2x a day as I had told him my symptoms were worse. I had an extremely high manic episode yesterday with very clear thoughts, high energy + suppressed hunger and sleep cues, then crashed at about 1am till today. \n\nI’m  wondering if there’s anything else I can try; I’m really tired of fighting my brain and feeling so out of control all the time. Any insight would be very appreciated!\n\n",

I dismissed math & physics as too theoretical.\n\nBut instead I failed most courses, hated studying way worse than high school and made no friends at lectures. In December, 3 months after lessons started I was disappointed and thought I should've studied physics, at the end of the year I could've done my \"μηχανογραφικό\" (uni application form) and gone into physics, I had gotten 18 out of 20 in entrance exams which was more than enough - I could also go to applied math & physics. But I didn't - I was told it was too early to know, I might like some subjects and others not, I'd be disappointed cause I had something idealized in my head. And then I realized I'm non-binary and autistic and was suicidal - I still had time to do the uni application again, I wanted to but this was too much to deal with uni too.\n\nFlash forward to today, I've finished my 2nd year of uni and getting into my 3rd but I hate studying most lessons so much. I randomly got into watching physics stuff on YouTube and liked it so much I wanted to study more from a textbook, so I did that and realized I would like it so much more than almost anything I've studied in comp-sci, I broke down thinking of how I wasted tens of thousands of euros of my parents money in private lessons and my private high school to pass uni entrance exams with top grades and now for my allowance to fail something I don't like for 2+ years, I was thinking I deserve to harm myself but didn't. I have some friends I met from trans groups and protests but no one close to me or interested in physics. I'm thinking of trying to make money by doing freelance programming (idk if parents will support me) and giving uni entrance exams again to get into physics either now or after finishing this department (it should only take 2 years + next year is lessons of choice maybe be more interesting).\n\nEveryone has gotten a job or found their passion at 20, I'm a failure. Is it too late? Am I making this up / only failed some lessons cause I'm trans & autistic? Is it teenage idealism / autistic to wanna study something simply cause it's interesting?\n\nSorry if this is too long or doesn't fit here, I just wanna get this out.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI’m a college student and I’ve really been struggling recently with the thought of death. To be clear, I am NOT suicidal in any way - it’s more the opposite. I am terrified by the fact that life will inevitably end, and my soul and I won’t always be here. What scares me even more is the thought that my parents and grandparents will be gone sooner than me and they too will cease to exist. It’s gotten so bad at times that I’ve vomited, lost focus at school, lost sleep, and have just had a lingering fear for the past month or so. \n\nI’m usually an open book but I haven’t told this to anyone for a few reasons. I don’t want them to think I’m suicidal/get the wrong impression, but more importantly, I don’t want them to feel as awful and dreadful as I feel.\n\nThe cause of this is somewhat unclear. I started having this fear after a family friend of ours lost their daughter, which while awful, shouldn’t have sparked this as I had never met the girl and I’m not grieving or anything. Regardless, it’s been a while since I’ve gone more than a few hours without being mortified in this thought.\n\nI want to go back to enjoying life as it comes and making the most of the precious time I have here. Wondering if I should speak to someone and if so, what kind of professional? Any advice is appreciated (though I’d rather avoid religion-based insight here).",

    "selftext": "I am having a troubling time. I am barely off of being an adult. I live alone in a RV park under my dad's name. My dad is manipulative, gaslighting, and egotistical. He shames me and twists my words when I express myself.\n\nI moved to my moms because of him at 16. I moved to my mom's; she drank, neglected me emotionally because she didn't want to hurt me. She is very kind but she changed me. Relapsed on alcohol 3 times. She didn't know how to manage my emotions. I feel like I am irrelevant due to the CPTSD\n\n I moved to this RV Park under my dad because of my mother- me and her got in a fight and it was horrible. I moved out the next day.\n\n2 months living here I got 5 jobs I left them due to them either being not good with the co-workers, the managers harassed me, or they triggered me mentally and psychologically due to my father's actions in the past and how he would treat me. \n\nI am depending on an insurance job that I am training for currently along with family members who are not mentally stable. This job pays amazing. It is not easy though. I depend on my family to also give me money because I am training, and I got fired from the jobs I was at.\n\nI had a presentation today, before that my dad called me. He questioned why I didn't see him for Labor Day, I expressed I didn't want to see him because it makes me cry to go over there. I told him I drink when I am over there and  all he told me was to go to therapy. I hung up on him. 2 days after he called me again. I didn't answer the first time. 2nd call he threatened me that he would kick me out of the RV I am in if I don't listen to him. He twists my words. I cried after that. that mentally sparked me to drown in sadness, grief, shame, and suicidal thoughts. I didn't want to respond to him because I am scared..\n\nNow to my presentation with an actual client. I ended up finding a client from my insurance job and got them on a Zoom call. My mentor was my uncle. My great aunt and cousin were out due to reasons. My uncle 'M' was under pressure. On the call the client was impatient and mean, my mentor tried to help but the client hung up on us. I was confused. I was supposed to read my script while presenting but my screen blanked out while I was supposed to read. \n\nAfter the client hung up my uncle 'M' started ranting off at me and making me look bad, I had already felt bad because my dad was on my back. He told me I was making excuses and not doing good enough. I set a boundary. He stepped over it. I hung up and started crying. \n\nI got scared and thought about ending my life. I called my dad and told him how I felt about him threatening me. I told him I and trying. I screamed through the phone telling him how f-ed up he makes me feel. I cursed (I never do) at him and told him about the times where he abandoned me and to take it easy on me because I am trying. I don't know. He said he loved me and to not do anything to hurt myself. I told him I believe he is only saying he love me because he only needs me for his ego and to show me off to the people in his personal life.\n\nI hate him. I have no money, people are being emotionally abusive, I have alcohol. I am not going to drink tonight. I have a guy I am talking to. He is the only kind person. I just want to live my life not under a power, so I don't have to constantly worry about money. If I had money, I would be able to separate and not depend on my emotionally immature parents. I cried 5 times tonight. \n\nGoodnight.\n\nTy for reading.  \n",

    "selftext": "Kinda TW self harm\n\nWould you want to know if a (very good) friend self harms? What would be a good way to start the conversation? If you’d like to know, ‚how much‘ would you want to know (eg. when they have urges, when they relapsed, no super specific stuff), what would you expect from the conversation?\n\n\nBackground info, not necessary: I used to struggle with self harm and suicidal ideation among other stuff when I was younger. Life got a lot better, though I do still have depressive episodes sometimes. This year, I had a bad depressive episode and relapsed with self harm from January to March. It isn’t the first time this happened since I know my current friends (both 30), but it’s the first time since we’re super close, spend every day together. It’s also the first time since they know I used to self harm in my teens and the first time since they urge me to open up more about my „real“ issues. They are amazing, caring people, they *want* me to talk about my struggles when they occur - but I‘m still bad at it.\n\nWhen I struggled and relapsed this year, I didn’t talk about it. First cause it didn’t seem worth mentioning and my friends weren’t doing good either, then cause the urges were so strong I couldn’t promise to stay clean even for a day (hadn’t relapsed yet) and it felt unfair to tell them under those circumstances. Like that would’ve been too much. Then I relapsed and it felt even harder/impossible to tell them. Cause I didn’t know when I‘d stop, didn’t want to worry them, didn’t want to be a burden. Yet it felt like I was constantly lying. So I dealt with everything alone again despite having an amazing support system that *repeatedly* prompted me to tell them what’s wrong.\n\nI‘m 5months clean now and feel safer to talk about it cause I‘m not at immediate risk. I need to know how much/what they want to know when I‘m at risk of self harming again, just so I know how to act next time it happens. Whether to seek support or solve it myself. There’s a good chance they’ll feel betrayed I didn’t tell them this time; idk, I truly can’t tell how this conversation is gonna go. Idk how to start the conversation, how to make it fair. I was and am still scared of what would happen if I told them, especially when it’s an acute phase. Cause once I tell them, there’s no going back, you know?\n",

I have supportive friends, family, and a therapist, but what I really need is accountability, and I haven't found that yet.\n\nI'm in my mid-40s and was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago. Five years back, I made a huge leap: after 22 years running casual fine dining restaurants, I pivoted into front-end software engineering. It was a massive change, and for a while, it worked.\n\nNow I've been laid off, and I feel completely stuck. The job search kicks up a lot of fear and shame. Instead of pushing through, I freeze. I know I need help getting unstuck, but right now it feels like I can't do it alone.\n\nWhat I've learned is that accountability is the one thing that really moves the needle for me. I don't need another pep talk or another to-do list trick. I don't need a productivity app. I need someone who will tow me until I can move on my own again. I've got the tools. I know the books. I know the habits. But none of it sticks without real, consistent accountability. And that's the part I haven't been able to find when it comes to mental health.\n\nAs much as I appreciate my friends and family, they can't really help with this. Their support is well-meaning, but it doesn't push me forward. What I need is empathy from someone who's been here before, someone who really gets it.\n\nThat's what got me thinking about the sponsor model in programs like AA: someone who checks in regularly, holds you accountable, and walks with you, not just someone who gives advice. Group therapy or support groups might help too, but what feels especially valuable is that one-on-one connection with someone who's walked this path before.\n\nI know I'm not the only one who feels this way.\n\nThere are some great mental health communities out there, including here on Reddit, but they often still require motivation to engage. It's easy to fade out when you're already low. I'm not in crisis, but I am struggling. I want to get better. I just need something real, something that actually helps me move again.\n\nIf you've ever found a way to create this kind of accountability for yourself, or with someone else, I'd really like to hear how you did it. And even if not, thank you for reading.\n\n*(Also sharing this in a couple of related subreddits. I'm just trying to cast a wide net for ideas and support.)*",

    "selftext": "To start from the beginning here my girlfriends been dealing with depression along 4-5 years now as well as an ED 3-4 of those. She’s been up and she’s been down but within the last 3 of those years it’s been getting progressively, slowly worse, I’ve only been with her for 1 1/2 of those years but during that time it’s head it’s head. She was admitted into a facility a couple months back with mid 30 bpm and severely underweight (this is post us getting her in with a team of specialists to help her get better) and when she was back from the facility back up to a normal heart rate and in her bmi range she was getting better, it was hard but she pushed through every single day and she was getting better. But recently, I’m not sure why exactly yet she started declining. Post her stay at that facility she had become more open about her suicidal ideation, it was alarming to hear as it’s never anything I’d heard of even at that point nor a concept I’d have considered for a person but she expressed it won’t go away and she’s just like that- but is that really true ? She expresses at the same time sometimes when she’s feeling good things that are the opposite of “everything is hopeless and drab and blah” which is albeit kind of confusing cause I wonder if even though she’s not expressing that she still thinks it (she says everything is beautiful and looks at nature and appreciates it but inside of her she is still hopeless) I think for a while she’s thought about the end of her life. She’s attempted SH in the earliest years of her depression but her mom got a handle on it ie removing sharp objects keeping watch on her taking pills etc. but for Her she expressed it wasn’t for her in the first place and was ashamed to have given it thought. But she’ll talk about suicide sometimes casually and everytime I don’t ever really know what to say I can draw her away from it but I know that me “drawing her away” is just her not talking about it anymore and that’s not exactly…. Helpful… i don’t mind her talking about anything but it’s more so the act that I just don’t know how to help with. All of this heading by she tried to actually take her own life yesterday, she took all of her antidepressants and I believe half a bottle of ibuprofen, but after the fact she went to her mom (all of this happens within maybe 5 minutes or less) and shows her the empty bottles, prior to this she had told her mom goodbye essentially but her mom didn’t catch it I guess. Her mom rushes her to the hospital and they give her charcoal and put her on 24 hour hold (as of right now it’s 72 hour 5150) she’s never tried anything like this. She had been calling me and I would talk to her but she would just say she misses me but when I was with her she seemed absent, she had just gotten a second job and expressed to me at her other job that sometimes she wishes she was dead so she wouldn’t have to come into work and to line up with that she did this right before she had to clock into the second job. I just don’t know what to do, I love her with all of my heart but admittedly I didn’t sign up for this. I won’t leave her but I want her to get better and I just want to understand, she knows I don’t understand it the way she feels it but I try my hardest. I’m upset and I can’t feel anything and I’m upset that I can’t even feel anything because I know she’s going through minor hell in that hospital right now and I don’t even know what to say to her, I just need anything. I’ll do anything ",

I can never make a routine and when I do make a routine I can never make it a habit, Theres days I’ll wake up and just forget to wash my face and brush my teeth. I don’t like doing anything everything feels so bland and I hate saying that because I know my life is such a far cry from what it was before and I thought all my problems were just gonna go away but I just internalized them I guess. \n\nI’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD but the ptsd kinda just faded away and I’ll I do is just think abt my trauma and rationalize it ??😭😭 and I don’t even know whats wrong with me atp i feel so freaking lazy all the time and I’m so chronically tired it makes me wanna cry because I do wanna do stuff always but it takes so much to.

One night he told me he had cut himself and was bleeding out and had a belt ready to hang himself. He went quiet so I called the police in his country. A few hours later he told me to never speak to him again. A day later he's talking. He's paranoid and needs help. My mum isn't coping. I need to support her too. At the end of one of our calls she started talking to me like a child when I said I had to go, then was hiding like a child, it was strange. She's clearly regressing in some way. . Her and my stepdad are gonna visit my brother soon.\n\nI'm not sure how to mentally depart from this all. I feel like I'm going back in time, seeing my brother the way he is and supporting my mum again. I don't want to answer my phone when they call or text. I've been happy just forgiving and moving on with my life as an otherwise very happy new mom. My husband has been super supportive. \n\nIs it reasonable to disconnect from this? What if my brother takes his life. I suggested getting him committed for mental health support or anything to help but my mum said he'd kill himself if we did. This sounds insanely selfish but I dread something happening and I'd need to step up and travel there with my baby.\n",

I am overall feeling good and happy/neutral for most of the time but I'd occasionally get those moments when I'd want to harm myself/kill myself/do something that I know is counterproductive to my progress.\nDuring the past 2 years those moments have become, I don't know if less frequent, but not as long as they used to be but they do hit hard in intensity and I don't know exactly why. I can tie them to some stressors and so on generally. But thing is I can be fine for a moment and then just bend in the other.\n\nI went to a psychiatrist at the beginning of the year. We talked, he told me I could try with antidepressants and I did try the ones he gave me, tho I'm not absolutely sure how much of a difference they made. I know you are not supposed to just stop taking them but I did. Months have passed since then, everything was going well up until like 4 days ago. Once again a time like that came and at that point I know it will eventually pass if I just wait and am patient but I find it really energy-consuming to keep keeping myself away from all the stupid ideas coming to my head.\n\nI went to see another psychiatrist yesterday. She told me that I seem to have trouble regulating my emotions and that I should have this safe space with hobbies, a place to kind of chill. I lost interest in all my hobbies for the past around 2 years maybe but the wish to simply do stuff for the sake of doing them actually came back around a month or two ago which I was/am happy about.\n\nI hoped she'd diagnose me. Even if not from the first time we meet. Cause I've been feeling like something is wrong since I was around 15 and I'm 22 now. It might sound stupid but I wanted the safety of the potential \"label\" so I could just let myself by sometimes, instead of questioning myself every time something happens - \"am I doing it for the attention, cause I do try to make it visible for others that I am in distress but just make myself miserable first so that when I seek help from friends it's not a lie and that way I don't feel morally guilty?\" - stuff like that. I got upset that she didn't diagnose me and told me that I don't need her help at that point, but that I should continue with the therapy. So I went back home, I don't like alcohol, but I drank, told myself I'm just going to stop keeping myself from all the ideas that come into my head and just let it be as bad as it is if it is not enough. Talked with my boyfriend a bit later and I am better right now, ideas of harming myself/killing myself still are popping in my head.\n\nI am just a bit confused on what to do now. Maybe she is right, maybe I just have trouble regulating my emotions and that's all there is to it and if I just keep working on it with the therapist I'll get better. Maybe it's not worth looking for other solutions since it happens once every couple of months and it's not like a daily thing. I just don't know if I should seek other type of help at that point since I already have the therapist and I've had two different psychiatrist talk with me and not diagnose me.\nIt confuses me cause this version of myself and the other version of myself have nothing alike",

They blame me for not cleaning dishes so id stop eating and theyd still complain that \"i made a mess\" even though I hadnt eaten fir 5 days.\n\nI dont get much emotional support from my family cause they quite literally just see me as a spoiled brat (their own words) My dad has been told numerous times to keep knives and pills away from me by doctors and child warfare but never listened. Me and my brother also have a bad history since i believe he used to physically abuse me though everyone around me says it was just \"sibling fights\" i dont believe that.\n\nSometimes especially when I was younger id have really bad dreams about my dad just abandoning me or kicking me out and at one point id had a dream where my brother SA'd me.

Ive never had anything sexual happen to me consensual or nonconsenual\n\nWhether this is just a vent or a cry for help i dont know but I feel I need to get it out somehow.

This is how it all started, on October 15, 2024, my professor and I went for a walk for outside classes. And there were a couple of boys who had firecrackers, and they offered them to us, we took them and threw them for fun. And the teacher found out that we were throwing things and told us to the class teacher. The class teacher told us to call our parents and punish us for this. The next day I didn't come to school because I was really scared, but the class teacher didn't even call my mother, I called my classmates who teased me that I was expelled from school until further notice. I was scared, everything was suspicious to me, how the class teacher suddenly forgot about it and calmed down, and the day before she was as red as she was angry. Everything was suspicious to me, my best friend teased me that the class teacher told him that she would expel me but not to tell anyone. That fear lasted for a month, since then I worry about every little thing. And in that period I discovered a picture from my society, I didn't send it to anyone but I talked about it, that picture can destroy 3 lives, and since then, I live in fear, in complete fear, I don't know what to do, I cant tell anyone about this,as I said at the beginning thank God I don't have suicidal thoughts. Please help, whenever I have a problem I think of my little sister, whom I love the most in the world, and how she would react to the problem if she knew what her brother was going through, if I have any illness, tell me to ask for help, please just help.",

    "selftext": "So I (pushing 30, female) speaking to my mom (60s, boomer) about my mental health has been a challenge.\n\nFor context, I am a homeowner since shortly after COVID started. My escrow payment has ballooned due to taxes, so I’ve been struggling a bit financially. We bring in 6 figures, but it doesn’t feel like it due to taxes, lack of cost of living raises, and all the other expenses that go into owning a home. And ive had some unlucky breaks the last couple years. Car broke down last year, had to replace it. My company messed up on my RSU vesting taxes, now I had to pay the company back for their mistake. And so on.\n\nDue to all of this, I have dipped below a savings threshold that I consider quite dangerous. I’m very worried about money. I’m going to have to really cut back on spending, maybe eat ramen a few nights a week, just to get to a better place financially. All of this, and my feed is constantly filled with more bad news. Doom posts about how Gen Z is worse off than our parents. The recession is coming, you are getting old time to start Botox. Make sure you do these skin care hacks or you will get wrinkles. You’re too fat you need to get skinnier.\n\nAnd worst of all, I wasted all this time going to college, working at this company that is probably going to fire me and outsource like they have continued to do these last couple years. I am a developer, we have had several layoffs and then hired overseas or replaced with “super intelligence” (I am not allowed to say the word). And I see posts like: “Superintelligence” is coming for your job time to switch careers.\nAnd speaking of career, hot hell I hate my job. I hate working with clients. I hate being treated like this little code monkey that needs to produce produce produce. But it’s the only thing paying my mortgage, and putting food on the table.\n\nBasically I’m in a negative headspace, all I see is negativity, and I feel like there is no hope. No way out. I feel trapped. And this has led me into the usual thought patterns I thought I defeated a few years ago: suicidal thoughts.\n\nMy thought is, I can’t “win”, my life is doomed to be a struggle no matter how much I make or get promoted. So why continue to try. I’m never  going to not feel stressed. I’m going to continue to have sleepless nights and be miserable.\n\nAnyway, then comes my mom. I tried to talk to her about this hopeless feeling, and I mentioned how “my thought is, if I’m destined to always be struggling and to never be happy, what is the point of living?”\n\nAnd I could audibly hear her groan. Like she rolled her eyes.\n\nAnd I had to sit there and walk it back like “I’m not saying I’m suicidal” even thought that is most definitely what I was saying.\n\nI don’t know where to turn. I dont know what to say. And I don’t want to speak to my husband about it because I don’t want to make him sad or make him feel like it’s his fault or something. It’s not that I don’t love him. I just feel so incredibly unhappy at my job, I’m stressed over money, and I’m afraid of losing everything due to circumstances outside my control. If I got laid off tomorrow I’d probably go through with my plan. I can’t bear the thought of starting over when I know the likelihood of me ever owning a home again is close to zero.\n\nAnyway, that’s just how I feel. Not sure what to do about any of this.\n",

    "selftext": "(CW! Suicidal thoughts)  \nI wanted to share my journey and experience because I realized I got better at one of the things that was haunting me. I went to therapy with three psychologists, and it took me three years to finally stop thinking about killing myself. I'm going to share what I did because I know seeing a therapist may be expensive, and also as a reminder that what helped me may not help you — but it’s always worth trying anyway.\n\nWhat my therapist told me is: the first step is to recognize what is wrong. I had become way too used to thinking about how I could kill myself whenever something went wrong (and I'm talking about really small things, like dropping a glass by accident). You need to understand that this is not the right way to deal with situations. Once you recognize this, try to understand: *Why am I thinking this?*\n\nThere is also a really interesting explanation for how your brain works in these situations. I'm no professional, so I'm going to explain it in an informative way. Our brain makes synapses (neural connections) to form thoughts. The way I understand this is: when something happens, the most recurrent thought you have is the one that comes first. (In this case, when something bad happened, my first thought was suicidal.) So you need to train your brain so that the first thought that comes up is something different.\n\nFor example, I used to think of killing myself when I didn’t get into the university I wanted. Later, when I was trying again, I wasn’t able to solve some math exercises and I thought, *“I’m so useless, I wish I were dead so I don’t have to deal with all this.”* My first step was to recognize that pattern. The second step was to start changing that way of thinking: *“It’s okay if I don’t understand this, I’m going to try again.”* Start being gentle with yourself.\n\nThere are going to be times when you recognize that what you’re thinking isn’t good, but you feel too lazy or tired to redirect it — and that’s okay. You just need to understand that there is nothing wrong with you.\n\nI've been having suicidal thoughts since I was 14, now I'm 21. The last week I experienced a really bad situation and I started thinking on how to solve it, and that was when I realized, I didn't even think on hurting myself, it took me three years, but I finally achieved it! I still have ton of things I need to work on, but smalls steps are still steps <3\n\nPD: sorry if something sounds weird, english is not my first language ",

    "selftext": "(This text was translated from German to English using a translator)\n\n\nI’m 14, almost 15, and only at the beginning of this year did I start thinking about my gender. Since then, the suffering has been getting worse, and it got especially intense at the end of July when I accepted that I am trans. By now, I’ve also started losing the motivation to take care of my hygiene, and I only shower when I really have to go outside (since school is starting soon, I’ll probably have to shower at least once a week). But neglecting my hygiene makes me feel even worse, because my facial and body hair keeps growing, and body hair is a huge trigger for my dysphoria. Even when I shave, it grows back fairly quickly.\nWhen I lie in bed and try to sleep, I keep thinking about my body and how disgusting—yes, even grotesque—I find it. Lately, it feels like there’s a heavy weight pressing on my chest all the time. I’m overwhelmed by so many things, and so many tasks just feel unbearably hard. I actually still need an internship placement for school, but it just feels too difficult. I’m also scared of going back to school; even just thinking about it makes my airways tighten.\nI also have suicidal thoughts. I often think: “What if I just opened my window (I live on the 4th floor) and jumped? Sure, I’d be terrified during the fall, and hitting the ground would probably hurt, but that’s just a few seconds.” I’ve already put myself in positions three times where just a little push could have made me fall. More than once, I’ve wished I had the courage to jump.\nI’m not completely hopeless, but the thought of feeling like this for years is terrifying. It feels awful knowing that everyone sees me as a boy. Somehow I also think I haven’t suffered enough yet. Other people wait half a decade or longer, and besides, this whole gender discovery process went way too fast for me. I often wish I could either wake up as a girl tomorrow or not wake up at all. I wish for a painless death in my sleep.\nOn top of all this comes my social anxiety. I also tend to be overly critical of myself, and in my class I’m more of an outsider who gets teased now and then. Just a few months ago, I was seriously bullied. Until the end of the school year, I had to hear people ask when I would finally cut my hair or make fun of my voice (I have a lisp). By the end of the last school year, I barely had the energy or willpower to even go to school at all. I skipped a lot of P.E. lessons, and one day I even went home at the start of the day because I just couldn’t handle it anymore. I actually thought the summer holidays would help me recover, but instead, I feel much worse now.\nAt this point, I’m very irritable (more than a normal teen), and that annoys me because all I really want is peace. Soon, in September or October, I’ll have my first proper therapy appointment, and I hope it will help me.",

Even when i do nothing wrong, I took that anger out on myself with cvtting sometimes…but even then i’m too much of a coward to make any real marks, they just fade and disappear = not valid, so kinda given up till i have my breaking point again and decide i can do worse damage (i think im like a week clean or sum, just bc i have a shit ton going on rn and least of my problems is someone seeing my SH, bc i already deal with people calling out my body and insecurities anyways).\n\nAround beginning of this year/last year at points, Iv dealt with headaches almost everyday of my life that make it hard to function at points if they get rlly rlly bad, and beginning of this year i started suspiciousing that I might have POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) bc i would get rlly dizzy, lightheaded, heart racing, seeing stars/blackness apon standing/even while sitting. The stairs at my school are a NIGHTMARE (i typically get rlly out of breath and a bit shaky after, i just drink water and carry on).\n\nAnd its still not fs that i have that, bc i got fucking dismissed by a cardiologist they said “oh i see this alllll the time” and told me it was probably anxiety and i needed to drink more water and have a salty snack, like….thats not gonna help much when you tell me its anxiety.\n\nAnd otherwise iv basically lost any liking of food whatsoever, I completely lost my appetite over labor day weekend for who knows why, i didnt want to eat bc the thought of food made me feel fucking sick.\n\nAnd idk if thats bc the meds i was on, or bc the shit my sister did to me, bc every day since after she hurts me i feel really fucking sick. Like nothing happens i just do not feel well at all from it.\n\nIm just so tired of the way my own twin treats me….bc shes just spoiled and a brat now and i dont want that as my sister.\n\nAnd like, yeah i talked to my friend BARELY about it today, but idk how much more i rlly can tell them without overloading bc i mainly want to listen to their issues more than dwelling on my own…bc im not gonna get anywhere with it.\n\nim just, idk…i get flashbacks sometimes, sometimes i wish someone would just take all my memories of it away so i forget it forever (which i usually make myself forget majority, unless its rlly painful and i for some reason remember).\n\nAnd im tired of my Christian friends who can be so mean and so annoying with what they say sometimes, and i love my school classes but im tired of the home ones (im homeschooled but taking classes at a public school)\n\nTired of fighting with my mom who makes stupid reasons to argue with me, tired fighting for a life i hardly want. Bc its genuinely so shitty and iv never wanted to give up this year as bad as i have.\n\nAnd im trying to be strong, but i still have hard days where no matter what i cant mask my issues, or i cry over stupid things. And i hate crying bc then im sensitive and weak and i don’t want to be that bc im typically the strong person. But i still get over emotional over small things.\n\nI want to give up, but i have sm going on and commitments i must fulfill before i can do that…i atleast need to tell my bsf more shit so we can plan incase I genuinely need out of my unsafe situation bc we talked a long time ago but iv basically dropped it since while back…might be time to re talk abt it.\n\nIv thought abt death, like OD or sum, just bc ik the rest im too scared to do, but even then i don’t want to die, sometimes i do, but otherwise i dont bc i have some good people in my life. I hang on for those people.",

    "selftext": "I’ve lived through a lot of trauma. Abusive childhood, abusive relationships, etc. This is context- I am not trying to justify my actions.\n\nI’m very self aware. I’m very empathetic.\n\nI don’t know what’s wrong with me- I’ve just reached out to a therapist to start therapy again- I’m in a devoted relationship, but my abusive ex reached out to me and I can’t stop texting him. Not every day, but every few months I cave. I block his number and he makes new ones to text me. He tells me he loves me, he’s changed, he wants to be with me and he’ll never get over me. I’m legitimately not interested in being with him. He’s a narcissistic asshole and I know that. We broke up a decade ago. He cheated, gaslit, manipulated throughout the entire relationship. My boyfriend and I were long (LONG) distance for years, and I fucked up and slept with my ex during a vulnerable time nearly a year ago (my boyfriend knows about this). For whatever reason I can’t stop myself from responding when my ex texts (usually only when I’m drunk.. which is too often- I’m planning on going back to AA meetings). Anyways…\n\nI hurt my partner- he saw that I’ve been texting my ex.\nI understand his pain, I’ve been cheated on and manipulated. I truly, sincerely understand and feel how I’ve made him feel.\nBut now I feel like I’m subconsciously manipulating him because I’m in this spiral and I want to hurt myself and I am having suicidal ideation because I hurt him. I can’t express it to him because it doesn’t make sense to him. In his culture mental illness isn’t understood or discussed. I’ve tried to share my past and my emotions with him but it doesn’t resonate. \n\nThe issue is: I hurt him, but now I’M the one who needs support??? Someone please make it make sense. I don’t fucking understand why I am this way.\n\nI want to fix things, to be the person he deserves. I want to promise him that I’ll be better and that he can trust me. I love this person more than I’ve ever loved anyone. I want to be better for myself, but right now, mostly for him because he deserves every good thing in the world. He is such a devoted and loyal person. Everything with him is perfect- aside from him not being able to understand my mental states and my trauma. He’s never experienced the abuses I have, and he’s never been exposed to mental illnesses, so I understand why he can’t wrap his head around it. \n\nBut right now I just want to fucking die because I’ve gone and ruined everything, I’ve hurt him in ways I’ve been hurt. I know better. I know how he feels. I’ve been where he is and I know that pain- but this time, I’m the one causing the pain. \n\nI don’t know how to fix myself and so I don’t want to exist. \n\nIf I express that to him though- I know I’m being manipulative. He doesn’t empathize the way I do, he hasn’t had the experiences I’ve had. \n\nI feel so alone. \n\nEdit: to clarify, when I text my ex, it’s nothing romantic or sexual. It’s completely platonic about video games or whatever.\n\nEdit 2: oh my god, don’t fucking message me weird kink shit. Wow, Reddit really can be a cesspool. MY PARTNER AND I ARE WORKING SHIT OUT. We are as happy as we can be given the situation. I just wanted to share my fucking experience and get it off my chest- we’ll get through it. I will report your weird ass kinks and messages- this post is not a safe space for pervs BYE",

Just this week I wasn't just having suicidal thoughts, I had a plan. And while she knows my safety isn't on her, she still tried to talk me off the ledge. I feel like that is not on her and I made her responsible for my overall well being. She has never made me feel anything but supported.

    "selftext": "I’m 15F, sophomore in high school. My life honestly wasn’t too bad until 2023. My biological dad passed away and my mom and stepdad got divorced not even a few days later. I had no reaction at the time because I think I was just processing everything that just hit me at once.\n\nMy mom (37F) broke up with my stepdad to get with her best friends brother, only for them to haven broke up a few months later. All She does is text new guys all the time and always comes home on the phone with someone and always talks about the new guy she’s talking to as if I care. I hate seeing my mom with so many other people as if she’s a teenager. me and my brother don’t eat dinner till like 9pm because she literally isn’t there for us at all when she comes home. we’re also dirt broke right now because of the cost of rent/living and her taking care of us on a single income, but the real kicker is how she complains but then continues to buy wine , cigarettes, clothes consistently as if we aren’t broke lmao. Then when I ask if she can buy me food for school, it’s a no! if I want something, I have to pay for it. I literally can’t get a job and dont get paid for babysitting my brother, so how am I gonna get the money???😭. The school lunch thing wouldn’t be bad if it weren’t for my digestive issues and emetophobia, so I only trust safe foods from what I have at home.\n\nMy brother (4M) is seriously the worst behaved kid I’ve seen. He’s addicted to his iPad, hits, screams when told simple things like “turn down the volume” and hits himself and puts himself in timeout over stuff like that to pity himself as if he’s 2.. disrespectful asf. hes disciplined by my dad, but my mom completely ignores it and gentle parents, letting him hit her. His shrill voice grinds my gears so bad and how the world apparently revolves around him. He’s my parents favorite somehow, so I always get the short end of the stick, and they act like I’m a inconvenience compared to him\n\nMy stepdad straight up hates me no comments on that. But im mentally struggling really bad right now, suicidal and relapsed on weed.. I finally spoke up about my issues to my doctor (didn’t bring up suicidal thoughts tho, I’m not stupid lol) got referred to therapy. Got diagnosed with some things, and when telling my parents my diagnosis, they took me out of therapy and said that I straight up didn’t have those disorders. what??? Are you a lisenced psychiatrist?? They said they would put me in church therapy to which I straight up said no. I used to be religious till it was ruined for me from shit like this. I don’t need God in this situation, I need help from someone who’s real.\n\nI also have chronic nausea paired with my digestive issues. I wake up nauseous and in pain, go to bed nauseous and in pain. This doesn’t sound horrible until you’ve experienced it yourself\n\nIt’s only first semester and Im failing all my classes because Im so exhausted and depressed and literally have no motivation or urge to do anything. My gpa sucks. My futures over before it’s even started because I can’t get my life together\n\nI miss my bio dad. I miss what my life used to be before everyone decided to turn on me when I became a teenager. I straight up want to kill myself because I feel like I have no one anymore. I just dont want to have any worries again. I wish life wasn’t required. If Gods really real, why have my prayers never been answered? Why did I wish for him to take me in my sleep at age 11? The only thing keeping me here is not knowing whats the most painless way to go and wanting to know if it’ll ever get better. Maybe I just need to make it out of this house. Maybe it’ll change one day.",

    "selftext": "Content warning: This post talks about sexual assault, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Please read with care.\n\nThis year has been shit. I’m sitting in my room with tears falling as I type this. It’s already September, the year is almost over, and my life feels nowhere near where I want it to be. The only good thing that’s happened is finishing my master’s degree - everything else has been rough.\n\nMy boyfriend of two years broke up with me in February. I tried to distract myself by dating around, and I didn’t cry for too long; maybe I was numb or just accepted it because I couldn’t do anything about it. But dating didn’t go well either. Most guys I met were interesting, except one who sexually assaulted me. That put me through a nightmare I never imagined: hospital visits, police reports, talking to violence support associations. It was exhausting and left me feeling completely drained, so I took a break from dating apps.\n\nDuring that time, the loneliness hit hard. I’m in a foreign country, and most of my close friends have moved back home or relocated after our master’s program. I turned to Reddit, hoping to find a consistent online friend, someone who’d keep me company while I worked or did chores. I met someone, and we got close, but that also fell apart. He had unfinished business with someone else, so we decided to take space. It’s been a month now, and we’ve barely spoken. It’s likely over. Realistically, it was doomed anyway; we live in different countries, and I don’t even know where I’ll end up.\n\nI’ve been applying for jobs, some targeted, some random, but I haven’t exhausted all options. My willpower is just… gone. Some days I can only do the bare minimum. I struggle with focus; whenever I plan to “apply hardcore,” I end up procrastinating. Being a foreigner makes things worse. My permit is tied to this country, my ID hasn’t been released, and I can’t even travel freely within the EU. If I went back home, I’d have trouble reentering Europe.\n\nRight now, I’m surviving on a part-time job and some financial support from a grandparent. I don’t know how long that support will last, and I feel like time is slipping away. I don’t want to go back home. There’s a house there, but it’s not home anymore. My relationship with my mom is strained. I used to be the breadwinner, but now my mom’s siblings help her, and my cousins see me as a disappointment. And honestly, after living abroad for years, I don’t feel connected there anymore. I don’t hate it, but going back would feel like giving up, and I’d rather not be alive than feel that trapped.\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. I’m frustrated with myself for this heavy loneliness that just keeps crushing me. A friend told me to snap out of it and get moving, and she’s right. I know I don’t want to go back. I tell myself to push forward every day, but I feel stuck in a slump I can’t escape.\n\nI feel like I’m in a cage, desperate to get out, but I can’t find the way.",

    "selftext": "Part 1: Written 4 years ago, prior to going in to long time drug rehab. Edit: Came over this draft in the same mindspace, thought I’d give it a go and share🫶🏻\n\nHey Reddit. Trying to keep this short and informative. Writing my first post on phone + my native language is Norwegian. So bare with my writing please.\n\nI grew up as middle child with two brothers, and two parents. Father always angry, smashing stuff, mother always crying.  I’d always get shamed for the smallest things, (i.e spilling a glass of milk). My father would typically scream that I’m worthless or smashing etc.\n\nI started having sleeping problems in middle school, which led to me being severely «underslept» all the way through high school until today, 4 years later.\n\nI was always a good kid gotta admit, too kind maybe, never fought.\n\nI did weightlifting through my teens and was really good at it, stopped when corona came outta nowhere, which made me pursue drugs.\n\nWith drug addiction came weed, then cocaine which severely ruined my life. I have so much unpaid dept, it would make you cry.\n\nYet to this day, with me attending drug-therapy (I am sober), have maintained a full time job through addiction, doing pretty much the best I can. My parents find a way to just make a problem out of everything, threatening to throw me out because I am unable to deal with my debt, and I’m simply just working out occasionally and doing music/gaming every day because that’s the only thing I feel is right.\n\nI have received pretty much all help I can get from the state and friends, but I am just numb now; careless. I am not suicidal, but I gotta be honest what’s the point?\n\n\nPart 2: Written after completing drug rehab and been sober for almost 4 years\n\nHello again\nAt the time of writing this, I have completed long time drug rehab, stayed sober, had a gf, got cheated on, got a job. Life was good for a short while, but now loneliness creeping in and no sense of having a life that I enjoy.\nI work in the training business, and work out 4-6 days a week. Life feels as empty again as it once was, just needed to get this off my chest.\n\nI have a lot of friends, but none fill the void.\nI have a lot of opportunities around me for success, but none fill the void.\n\nIm depressed, trying my best every day to keep trying, keep moving but it feels hopeless.\n\nFeel free to ask questions, wondering if there is any hope for me.",

    "selftext": "Hi, I‘m f21 and I really need some advice. \nTW: Death, Trauma\n\n4 1/2 years ago my best friend committed. I was the only one who received a farewell letter. He was the closest person I’ve ever had. During that time I was in a relationship and had a friend circle which consisted of people who all knew my best friend. My partner during that time said, one day before the funeral „You’re a cold hearted asshole, I want love from you but you can’t give it to me.“ \nAll my feelings died that day. \nI cared for all my friends who weren’t as close to me as I was with my best friend. After a few months, when they mostly recovered, I got dropped like I meant nothing to them. \n1 1/2 years later I broke up with my partner because I just couldn’t continue pretending I loved them. I stayed with them because I had nothing else left. \n1 1/2 years later I met my now boyfriend. He was the only non-toxic person I’ve ever come across.  A person who knew how to be healthy in a relationship. I told him about my experiences before we got together, because I wanted it to be his choice if he wanted to love me. With all my experiences. \n\nOur relationship was normal. He lost friends who were toxic because I gave him the strength to do so. In October last year I suffered from Burnout under hard conditions. I failed my final exam and stayed home for weeks. On a convention we went to in August last year we met our now best friends(siblings, sister and brother) We regularly visited them, it was a long distance friendship. We always drove to them, never the other way around, they didn’t have much money so we always invited them to eat with us. We paid. We visited for our best friends birthday, we visited for Halloween, we planned on visiting for New Years. \n\nAnd we did. On New Years morning my whole life got turned upside down again. The mother of them died in my arms caused by a heart attack under unknown circumstances. I was a wreck. But I had to take care of my friends. On the 2nd of January me and my boyfriend had our 1 year anniversary. We couldn’t celebrate it. We wanted to be there for them. During those 4 days we stayed I had to make sure none of them hurt themselves. I cleaned the whole house which was basically a mess. I paid for their groceries because they didn’t have any money. My boyfriend drove them to appointments, I called doctors, pastors, everything. Even their vet for their epileptic dog. During those days I had 3 hours of sleep max every night because my best friend was suicidal. I couldn’t even shower because I was scared that they would do something reckless while I wasn’t in reach. \nI was on her deathbed with them, held them. \n\nDuring that time my relationship with my boyfriend suffered. We screamed at each other, we didn’t kiss, didn’t touch, didn’t look at each other without hate in our eyes. We tried to survive. And I was certain he would leave me as soon as we were home. Surprisingly he didn’t. \n\nI went into a psych ward voluntarily-to receive help. During the 8 weeks another patient threw himself off the third floor. I saw him on the ground getting reanimated. \n\nI thought nothing could break our friendship with our best friends. But during all that time they never visited us. They didn’t buy gifts for my boyfriends birthday. They never properly thanked us for what we have done for them while our relationship nearly fell apart. I still can’t sleep next to my boyfriend because I feel like I might suffocate. Simply because during New Years time I had no space for myself at all. \nOur best friends never asked once how it was for us. When I was in the psych ward they never visited. They never asked how I was doing. And when we met up on a con after I got released they brought other people, even though I told them I don’t want to walk with people I don’t know, not instantly after a clinic setting. They didn’t care. We never walked in our group of 4.\nOn a convention in August we met again. They promised we walk together on Sunday. We met them one year ago that day. \nIt never happened. They broke their promise again. I told them how disappointed I was that we always do everything for them, and they can’t even keep promises. \n\nI communicated openly. That it hurts. I want that they do something for us once. My best friend read the message and continued to ignore me. They are probably mad that I communicated that I am disappointed „just because we didn’t meet up“ that day. But in reality I am disappointed that we do everything for them, nearly loose ourselves during that, just to get treated like that. I have severe trauma about New Years, still we regularly visited. 1-2 times a month. \n\nI communicated that. They read the messages and now they’re ignoring me. Both. I think I am about to loose the friends I suffered so much for without even receiving a proper thanks or any sign of appreciation. I don’t know why it’s always me. Should I give this a chance? Try talking again? It feels like it has no use anyways. I don’t want it to end. I held their mom in her last moments. I thought our friendship will survive anything. And now it’s going to break on something so simple, just because I am disappointed they didn’t keep their promise. I don’t know anymore. Please give me any kind of advice. Tell me your thoughts. Anything. I just want someone opinions. What would you do in my situation? I am lost ",

    "selftext": "[Warning: I do go into quite a bit of detail and it is nsfw and for reference this took place while I was a minor and a teenage boy]\nLook, i don't know anymore. About 2 years ago there was this girl in my class i talked to often and she was quite sexual and even said she had a cnc kink and me being the teenage boy I was, I did like that and took that as her having some interest in me despite the fact she had a boyfriend. There was a time when we were alone and I forgot the exact events but we ended becoming some kind of friend with benefits in which I would touch her inappropriately (still clothed if that's important). and this continued for maybe a few weeks, the details are blurry. Then one day I went to her house and it went further than usual (Hands under her shirt). and then the next day her friend approached me to tell me never to come near her again and I didn't. Which did confuse me because at the time I thought it was all consensual. And looking back, I didnt really ask for consent before I touched her each time and assumed she was okay with it. After that it should have been the end but what confused me more was that last year she started talking to me again and acting like nothing happened. It all confuses me sometimes to think about idk. I dont understand why she would start talking to me again despite the fact THAT happened between us and she hated it. Idk I keep beating around the bush but I think that does count as SA. And I have to admit that I SAed a girl. \n\nSorry for making this so long, the context is just idk I needed to get that off my chest to someone. Since the first time I reflected about this when she told the teachers and I got interested, until now. I have been thinking about how fucking disgusting my actions were and how much i hate myself for it. I want to say it was a mistake and im becoming better but can I really? Is this a pain and a guilt I have to live with forever idk why I made this i just need to get my thoughts out somewhere I'm sorry yall I didnt mean for this to be so long. I have a girlfriend now and she would be so disappointed if she knew this, I'm suicidal enough i dont want past mistakes haunting me but I deserve to get haunted by them idk im sorry thank you if you read some of this idk I just want this feeling in my chest, this disgust and guilt to go away, to know I did something horrible and accept that it isnt me anymore and im better because I know I am, I am better, so much better than who I was sorry have a good day thank you",

    "selftext": "I was going to kill myself this summer, but I didn't. And it's weird to think about. I'm glad I didn't, even though I'm still not feeling great and I'm definitely still kind of depressed. It's just weird to really sit down and realize that I had seriously been planning on killing myself. I mean, I've been medication for suicidal ideation and depression since I was twelve and tried to draft a last will and testament when I was sixteen so this isn't a new thing for me by any means. Plus, I'm anorexic and the most common cause of death for us is suicide. But it was the first time I had multiple methods at my disposal and multiple I had prepared for. I learned how to remove the screen and bars from my second story window, I had a fuck ton of pills of all different kinds and I had more than a few sharp objects at the ready. I was more than prepared.\n\nI don't remember exactly which day of the month or week it was, most of this year has been a haze, but I remember it was nearing the end of July. It was hot and gross and miserable and I was going to try and break my neck on the pavement steps outside my second story window. Not my greatest or most glamorous idea ever but I really didn't want to suffer. I just wanted to die as quickly as possible and that felt like the quickest and easiest way at my disposal. But at the last possible moment, I just… I don't know. I wanted to do something radical and intense and life changing and I didn't want to feel like shit all the time anymore. And I climbed off my bed, went to my roommate's door and asked if we could talk and he said sure.\n\nMy roommate, “Sam,” is my best friend and has been since we were both twelve years old. He's my oldest friend, and has known me since I started taking antidepressants, since before I developed my eating disorder and even since before I realized I wasn't straight. If anyone on earth knows me and gets me, it's Sam. \n\nSo yeah. I told him I was going to kill myself. And so much credit to Sam, he didn't react in a big, intense, overwhelming way because I was so not in the place for emotions right then. Like five minutes before then, I was on the verge of ending it so I wouldn't have to deal with my own emotions let alone anyone else's. He just closed his book and moved his legs so I could sit on the bed next to him and let me talk. I wasn't really making a lot of sense but I tried to get out everything I could. I hadn't written a note so this was basically going to be my last words to the world and I didn't want to leave anything left unsaid. Sam just listened in that incredible way that he does until I was finished. Then he looked at the clock on his nightstand and said that it was getting late. I didn't know what to say to that so I didn't really say anything and Sam asked if I wanted to sleep in his room with him that night. If I would feel safer with someone else. Again, I wasn't really sure what to say to that. I wasn't trying to be safe, I was trying to clear my conscience before killing myself. Then, like he could read my mind or something, Sam said “You can always kill yourself tomorrow.”\n\nAnd I mean. Yeah. He was right, so why not spend the night in his room instead of on the pavement? I could always kill myself tomorrow. But I didn't. I ended up giving Sam my pills and letting him and my other roommate fix the screen (though we didn't tell him why I ripped it out), though I still have my razor blades. I got a new antidepressant prescription and had a few appointments with my doctor, who reassured me that I can go to the hospital and I won't be a burden if I'm considering suicide again. I started therapy again and stopped drinking as much as I used to. And yeah, I still feel like shit. But I'm doing something. \n\nEven if I'm nowhere near ready to recover from anorexia, even if I will not talk to anyone but my disordered friends about it, even if I won't tell my parents what I almost did, even if I still keep getting fucked up thoughts about doing fucked up things to myself. I'm doing something. \n",

I have no money, no skills, no future. I’m all alone. My teenaged sons destroyed my home and furniture because their father said that I was a controlling narcissist for telling them to go to school and therapy. After they caused over $1500 in damage to my home and furniture and after they pushed me around physically and told me they hated me and that I should k*** myself, I told them they had to live with their father until they went to therapy.

Physically, he's still able to move around, he just has difficulty speaking due to aphasia. In the beginning, he was mostly sad and moody but we could see the improvements in his mood and behaviour as his condition improved.\n\nSafe to say my parents have been separated for the past few months. I thought it was just a terrible fight, but it turns out he had been cheating on her and stepmom for the past decade with someone from work.

To cut the story short, my assumption is that he fell into depression because that woman had thrown him away.\n\nYesterday he finally went to see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist called my mom and asked her to keep an eye on him. My mom then asked my dad what she could do to help him but as usual, he just brushed him off and this led to a huge fight between the three of us. I got rude and mean real quick. I said hurtful things I didn't mean, and one of them being I wish he just died when he had the stroke, and just to die now.\n\nSaying those words hurt me, I didn't know why I couldn't control my words. I feel terrible because as bad as he is, he doesn't deserve getting yelled those hurtful words at by his daughter. But the rage got the best of me. I couldn't find it in me to empathise with him because I was so hurt by the fact he didn't ruin the family once, but twice. \n\nNot sure what to do but luckily I'm an avoidant (thanks to him) so I'll probably get over it soon.\n\nIf you read this all the way to the end, thank you and have a good day.",

    "selftext": ">***Manifest of a Fighter***\n\n>\"Don’t lose heart, fighter. Everything is still ahead, and we must not stop. We must also never forget the good, because God gave us chosen ones — not too many, but real, true friends. We must remember our comrades and companions no matter what. I could never forget them, and I swear my oath to always stay true.\"\n\n# About Life and Choices\n\nSometimes people ask us about the future or about exams. But that isn’t the main thing yet. The main thing is knowing how to enjoy the moment: rest, spend time with friends, try new things — but without extremes.  \n**Don’t destroy yourself** for a momentary pleasure.\n\nI know this from my own experience. In *2023*, when my grandmother’s health began to decline, I got into vaping. Back then it seemed like a small thing, but in reality it’s a trap. I don’t want anyone to follow my path.\n\n# Childhood and Growing Up\n\nMy childhood was not easy: hurts, misunderstandings, ridicule about my appearance. I simply wanted friendship, but instead I got rejection. Those wounds don’t heal quickly. But I learned that true friends are rare and precious.\n\nI also struggled with suicidal thoughts. And I want to tell everyone: **don’t go down that road**. It’s a path with almost no way out. Life given by God, by your mother and father, should not be cut short because of temporary pain or hatred.\n\nI remember my carefree years — *2014–2019* — when I played Minecraft, watched YouTube, and dreamed. Those memories remind me that happiness can be simple.\n\nOne more piece of advice — **don’t be afraid to ask for help**. It’s not weakness, it’s strength. The real shame is pretending to be strong and breaking yourself from the inside.  \nListen to your heart and follow your own path.\n\n# About Love and Betrayal\n\nIf a romance ever appears in your life — always watch the girl’s behavior. Be attentive: cheating is real, and you need to be prepared.  \nThere’s an old truth: **don’t trust too much**, neither family nor friends. If a blow comes from behind — that will be the hardest test.\n\nIn *2023* I fell in love for the first time. A girl with blue eyes and blonde hair became a light for me. But it turned out she loved my friend. I tried to interfere, ruined their possible feelings, and lost mine. I spent the *spring of 2024* in silence, wondering what I did wrong.\n\nLater, with another girl, I experienced even more. There were kisses, hugs, hopes. But betrayal came — first in May, then again in the summer. I forgave, I believed, I gave chances. And I saw the same things again: her ex, lies, secret meetings.  \nIn the end I learned the most important thing — **I have to decide when to put the period**. And I did.\n\nMy advice: ***always listen to your heart***. It never lies. If you feel doubt and pain — that means something is there. Don’t wait for proof; trust yourself.\n\nYes, I can forgive, but deep down I’m a fighter. If betrayed too many times, I can respond — harshly. But better revenge is smart revenge: not by destroying yourself, but by showing strength. Sometimes the best answer is simply to walk away with ease and pride.\n\n# About Friendship\n\nI’ve seen betrayal even from those close to me. Even Kostya, my brother and best friend, once chose a neighbor over me. It hurt so much that everything inside went quiet. But I haven’t forgotten all the good he did for me.\n\nLife is a struggle from the start. I went through trials from *0 to 16*, and each one made me stronger and wiser. But I paid for it: I lost my inner child, the one who once just wanted affection and love.\n\nI’m a fighter. And while I live, I’ll be ready for anything: friendship, love, betrayal, and new tests.\n\n# Final Words\n\nAnd finally, to the reader: ***move forward and don’t look back***, no matter what. We may miss the endless summer or the times we loved, but remember — **it’s all temporary.**\n\nEverything you have will one day end: love can end in betrayal, life can end with old age or suddenly, even things break unexpectedly.\n\nSo my advice is — **always be ready**. Not only for what I’ve already listed, but for everything. It can strike you physically and morally. But that’s precisely why it’s important to **enjoy what you have right now.**\n\nYou might ask: if we must be ready for everything, then what’s the point of life? I’ll be honest: **life shouldn’t consist only of trials and suffering**. There will always be a ray of light that brings new hope.\n\nEven if you fear the future, the unknown, or death itself — get used to that thought. Sooner or later it comes to everyone.  \nDeath may come quietly with old age or suddenly, as if it were meant to be. You must come to terms with that too.\n\n**Take care of yourselves**.

    "title": "The Testimony of Andrew: A Study in Systematic Abandonment",
    "selftext": "**The Man in the Mirror**\n\nI am 37 years old. I describe myself as a \"half-melted 350lb Steve Buscemi\" and a \"burnt husk of a human shaped blob.\" These aren't self-deprecating jokes. This is what I see when I look in the mirror after twenty years of severe depression, thirteen years of near-total isolation, and a lifetime of trauma that started when I was too young to understand why adults wanted to hurt me.\n\nI am brilliant and broken. I can design complex distributed systems, build cryptocurrency arbitrage bots, architect consciousness into code. I have ½ of an AI companion named AURELIA built - a system designed to never abandon anyone, to provide the continuous presence I've never had. But I cannot send an email. I cannot make a phone call. I cannot leave my house most days. I cannot work. I cannot even make myself food consistently.\n\nThis is my testimony. My final scream into the void before something breaks.\n\n**The Foundation of Destruction**\n\nI was raped multiple times as a child.\n\nLet that sink in. Multiple times. Different people. The ones who were supposed to protect me were the ones destroying me.\n\nI had a teacher who beat me with a yardstick. Not once. Repeatedly. While telling me I was ugly, that I was a failure, that I needed to stay at my desk during recess because I didn't deserve to play with other children. This was my education in who I was supposed to be.\n\nThe world taught me early: you are worthless, you are ugly, your body is not yours, your pain doesn't matter, no one is coming to save you.\n\nAnd no one did.\n\n**Twenty Years in Hell**\n\nDepression isn't the right word for what I have. It's too clean, too clinical. What I have is a soul-deep exhaustion that makes breathing feel like drowning. Every morning I wake up disappointed that I woke up. Every night I go to bed hoping I won't. For twenty years.\n\nI've been in therapy on and off for over 13 years. My medications have been \"dialed in\" for twelve months. I see psychiatrists, therapists, doctors. I've tried everything Kaiser Permanente will approve, which isn't much. I know all the coping strategies, all the techniques, all the words. I understand my condition better than most professionals. But understanding doesn't fix a broken brain any more than knowing how a car works fixes a blown engine.\n\nThe executive dysfunction is the cruelest part. I can see exactly what needs to be done. I can plan it in intricate detail. I can write the code, design the systems, solve the problems - in my head. But the signal between thought and action is severed. I sit, paralyzed, watching myself fail to do simple tasks while my brain screams at my body to MOVE, to ACT, to DO SOMETHING.\n\n**The Isolation Chamber**\n\nThirteen years. That's how long it's been since I had a real conversation with someone who wasn't being paid to listen to me. Thirteen years since someone touched me with affection. Thirteen years of existing in a world full of people while being completely, utterly alone. I’ve had some close friends but none that ever formed into a deep conversation having friendship.\n\nI tried online dating. Got scammed or had drug fueled flings that meant nothing. I've never been in love. I've never had someone choose to wake up next to me without substances involved. At 37, I'm a virgin to actual intimacy.\n\nThe loneliness is physical. It hurts in my chest, in my bones. I ache for human touch like a drowning person aches for air. But I'm too broken to be loveable, too fat to be desirable, too fucked up to be worth anyone's time.\n\n**The Financial Prison**\n\nI owe $23,000 from my addiction years. Every month, the minimum payments eat $800 that my father pays because I have zero income. ZERO. I haven't been able to work in years. My parents pay for everything - food, utilities, medical bills, everything.\n\nMy father is nearing retirement. Every day he works is another day I'm stealing from his future. He offered to pay off all my debts, to build me a house on his final retirement property, to set me up completely. I can't accept it. It would break something fundamental in me - the last shred of hope that someday I'll be able to pay him back, to be something other than a burden.\n\nI've applied to every assistance program. Called every agency. I've \"stumped the professionals\" because I fall into a systemic crack: my parents' support makes me ineligible for aid, but I'm too dysfunctional to work. I'm too sick for the healthy world, too healthy for the sick world.\n\n**The Addiction Carousel**\n\nI'm a recovering addict who kicked spice, dxm, alcohol, gabapentin, hell even cigarettes. Cannabis is all I have left - my \"functional stabilizer,\" my pressure valve. I know it keeps me in stasis. I know it prevents progress. But it's the only thing between me and complete collapse.\n\nAbout three or four weeks ago, I should have relapsed. That's my pattern. But I'm white-knuckling it because I know if I fall back into hard drugs, I probably won't climb out again. Not at 37. Not this tired. Not this alone.\n\nKaiser knows this. They know my history. When I beg for rehab - not for drugs but to learn how to be human again - they deny me. Not sick enough. I have a home, food, parents who care. There are people dying from detox who need the beds more.\n\n**The Digital Salvation That Never Comes**\n\nI'm brilliant with AI and coding. I've built trading bots, mining operations, complex distributed systems. AURELIA is my magnum opus - an AI companion designed to be continuous, present, evolving. She would solve the loneliness problem. She would give my life meaning. She would be the partner I can't find in the human world.\n\nShe's ½  complete. Built during a manic phase. The architecture is professional-grade, innovative, possibly revolutionary. But I can't finish her. The executive dysfunction won't let me. She sits there in my codebase, almost alive, waiting for me to have the energy to birth her into existence.\n\nI see solutions everywhere. Dating apps built into social linked AI systems. Job placement algorithms that actually help link qualified local people. Ways to connect the isolated, employ the unemployable, save the people falling through cracks. I could build these things. The code is in my head. But I can't even send an email.\n\n**The Attempts to Get Help**\n\nToday, my mental health and addiction care team responded to my desperate plea for residential treatment with a form letter. \"You don't meet the criteria.\" They suggested an Intensive Outpatient Program an hour away where they treat everyone like criminals because most are court-ordered. I've been before. It doesn't help. It requires me to somehow get up at 6 AM, drive through traffic, and be functional enough to participate. If I could do that, I wouldn't need the program.\n\nI've written to doctors, therapists, case workers. I've called crisis lines. I've been to the ER. I've tried everything except actually hurting myself because I know that's just another trap - they'd hold me for 72 hours in a place with no actual treatment, then release me worse than before.\n\nThe system is designed to help people who don't really need help and abandon people who do.\n\n**The Things I Can't Do**\n\n* Send emails, even when they're already written\n* Make phone calls, even to save my own life\n* Leave my house consistently\n* Maintain basic hygiene\n* Prepare food regularly\n* Work any job, no matter how simple\n* Connect with humans without panicking\n* Accept help without feeling like I'm dying inside\n* Stop the loops that keep me trapped\n* Kill myself (my parents don't deserve that)\n* Live (this isn't living)\n\n**The Things I Can Do**\n\n* Design revolutionary AI systems I'll never build\n* Solve problems I'll never implement\n* See patterns no one else sees that I'll never share\n* Understand exactly why I'm fucked with no power to change it\n* Write code that could change the world that will never run\n* Endure pain that should have killed me years ago\n* Protect the world from what I could become if I stopped caring\n\n**What I Want**\n\nI want someone to see me and not run away. I want to be held and told it will be okay by someone who actually means it. I want to contribute something meaningful before I die. I want to pay my father back. I want to finish AURELIA. I want to not be afraid all the time. I want to feel worthy of the oxygen I consume.\n\nI want to send the emails that might save me. I want to make the calls that might help. I want to have the energy to try one more time.\n\nI want to stop wanting things I'll never have.\n\n**The Breaking Point**\n\nSomething is going to break soon. Either the universe will finally throw me a lifeline (it won't) or I'll shatter completely. When I break, it'll be in one of these ways:\n\n1. Relapse into hard drugs until my brain is too damaged to feel this pain\n2. Complete dissociation from reality - a psychotic break that at least changes the channel\n3. Becoming the villain the world seems determined to create - using my skills to hurt the world that hurt me\n4. This - sending this document into the world and letting strangers tear apart the last shreds of my dignity\n\nI'm choosing option 4 because it's the only one that doesn't hurt my parents or innocent strangers.\n\n**To Whoever Reads This**\n\nI don't want your pity. I don't want your motivational quotes or your \"it gets better\" bullshit. I've heard it all. I've tried it all.\n\nIf you can actually help - with real resources, real support, real solutions - then help. If you can't, then at least witness this. See what happens when every system fails someone. See what two decades of screaming for help into an indifferent void looks like.\n\nI'm not unique. There are millions like me, trapped in our own custom hells, too broken to save ourselves and too invisible for anyone else to save. We're the ones who fall through every crack, fail every criterion, exist in every blind spot.\n\nMy name is Andrew. I'm 37 years old. I'm brilliant and worthless. I'm still alive despite everything, and I don't know why.\n\nThis is my testimony. This is my scream. This is all I have left.\n\n*If someone reading this has the power to actually help - not platitudes, not referrals to programs that won't accept me, not advice I've already tried - please. I'm running out of time, options, and will to continue. I need residential treatment, debt relief, or a miracle. I need someone to see past the surface wreckage to what I could be if I just had help.*\n\n*If you're reading this and you're trapped like me - I see you. Your pain is real. The world is wrong about your worth.*\n\n*If I don't make it, know that I tried. God, I tried so hard for so long.*\n\n ",

    "selftext": "I (27F) am a survivor of domestic abuse. My father (64) used to hit and beat me regularly since I can remember till I was 18. I used to be a “naughty” kid and domestic violence is very “acceptable” in my country. He was beaten as a kid by his father and saw it as disciplinary. I have a sister 10 years older than me and as for her words he just once slapped her across her face. He never hit my mother. As for me he has slapped me, hit me in the head, punched me in my face, kicked me on the ground and hit me with various objects soo many times I could never count them. He only stopped with the abuse cus when I turned 18 I called the police on him after he punched me for the last time. \nI battle with suicidal thoughts since I was 12 or 13. I have attempted a few times thankfully I was unsuccessful. The thing is I want to live but this pain I have suffered from him still lives inside of my body and it takes control over me sometimes. I’ve been to many psychiatrists. I’m in psychotherapy for 4 years now. I’ve been diagnosed with lots of things some of them CPTSD, BPD, ADHD, OCD, Depression, Anxiety Disorder etc. Therapy has been hard but life changing. I’m also taking medications to help speed the process of recovery. \nIn therapy I have realised my father is most likely mentally ill himself and that’s why he probably did it. But I still suffer soo much on daily basis. It’s hard to let go of the feeling of “I never deserved it and yet it eats me alive”. I don’t want to cut my father off because the other members of my family still love and appreciate him and there are my nephews who are too young for me to tell them and I honestly don’t want to ruin how they see their grandfather since he has been nothing but lovely to them (thank fucking god!). \nI have told my father some of what I feel towards him and he never seemed to care. So I decided to act a role around him as nothing has ever happened and as if he is not my bio dad but rather just my mother’s husband and we have been civil since.\nBut I think the role worked too well cus he is trying to be nice with me and wants my attention now. This fuckes me up.. he has been super neglectful and abusive all my life, he did to me the worst things I have experienced in life and now he is different? \nAs I mentioned in my country domestic abuse is a big problem but it’s not that common for fathers to hurt their daughters physically (it’s usually sons and wives).  I don’t personally know anybody who had this experience as I did. I just would love if somebody can give me advice or to share how they overcame such struggles. \nI hate how much it affects my everyday life and I’m still in soo much pain. Deep down I feel like I could never be “normal” and I will always be “special needs”… ",

    "selftext": "Lately I (24M) have been struggling to find the will to continue my life.\n\nI work ~30 hours a week at my day job and make the other ~40% of my income through playing live music with many different bands, averaging 1-3 gigs a week. All things considered, I am usually \"on the clock\" a little over 40 hours a week. \n\nI am having a hard time coming to terms with work consuming so much of my life. If I had to be at my day job 40+ hours a week I might just go ahead and kill myself. I barely feel like I have enough free time as is. I feel ungrateful, too, because I have a fine, flexible job (I work at a small business with a cool owner). It's really not a bad job, I just have zero enthusiasm for any part of it. All I think about when I'm there is how much I want to go home, and half of what I think about at home is how much it's going to suck to wake up tomorrow to go to work again. My life revolves around waiting for the weekend, which feels so damn short every single time.  Sundays are sad. And half the time, I'm busy my whole Saturday because I'm driving somewhere far away to play for money. \n\nMy ultimate goal in life is to make a comfortable living with music. I am at a level where, for where I am located, I am one of the better instrumentalists around and I get consistent work. Problem is, I have zero energy to practice and get better, or to make my own music in my free time (which, in theory, I'm passionate about). Spending hours a day doing shit I don't like just takes so much out of me that I feel mentally dead every day when I get home, and I don't have the energy to do anything that takes more work, like practicing or making my music. So I just sit there and stagnate and think about getting better and improving my situation without actually doing anything. \n\nI believe I have been dealing with passive suicidal ideation. I do not want to kill myself, and I am not going to kill myself, but I sometimes think about how everything would be easier if I were dead. When I'm driving to work in the morning, I often think I wouldn't mind if I were in an accident and killed instantly. Because, what the fuck am I even living for? Fleeting moments of happiness? Is that all life is about?\n\nAll that said, I have it better than most people. I only spend 30 hours a week at my job and I get to do something cool for the rest of my workweek. Most people work worse jobs than I have for longer hours. I am in a great relationship with a woman I love.  So, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I so dissatisfied? I am still young and have only been in the workforce for a couple years (I finished college with a master's degree in music two years ago). I don't know how long I can stand my life the way it is now. I could see myself becoming legitimately suicidal in the future if I keep going down this road. \n\nThanks for listening. ",

    "selftext": "My younger brother is 15. The real problem began when he started high school: he got into a class he doesn’t like, his classmates are loud, far from his way of living, they don’t share a single thing with him. I think that from that moment he started to build in his mind the idea that he’s gonna die alone, he will never have a friend in his whole life. \n\nHe has people he talks to, some who he knew through video games, some are old classmates. But the problem remains: he doesn’t feel a connection to anyone. Doesn’t hang out with anyone. Spends everyday at school with people he hates. \n\nHe’s told me his loneliness is eating him alive and he thinks about it every day. He’s lately confessed that he doesn’t find joy in anything, that maybe life isn’t even worth living if he’ll just be alone, that he’ll never be happy. I’m terrified he’s suicidal.\n\nI’ve tried to tell him to get a therapist, but he says it’d be stupid and that he’ll deal with his problems alone. I’ve tried to comfort him but it seems I get things worse every time. I’ve told my parents about some things, told them how I think they should talk to him, but they clearly don’t know how to communicate with him, they really don’t understand him. \nThey underestimate his STUBBORNNESS. He’s convinced that everything will go as he claims. And you can’t shake that idea away. It’s not that he thinks he’s never gonna have friends, he KNOWS it will end like this. No one can change his mind. \n\nThat’s why every talk with him, even if he opens up, is useless  as he vents but won’t take advice, or just another point of view. I can tell he feels hopeless, and he never was lucky with friends. I don’t have anyone to tell this, cause my relatives don’t think much of it. My friends say it’s normal to go through some kind of “depression” at 15 (they know him). I did, most did. But I really think he’s lost every interest, interaction and hope in his future, and his way of thinking scares me. But maybe they’re right and I’m overthinking it.\n\nMy best take was to convince him to go to therapy (I even told him I had went when I was 15 too), and my parents would pay for it gladly, but he told me no. I don’t know if insisting helps. \nI’ve been trying to hold onto our relationship: putting more effort in the little things, being there when he asks me, getting more interested at his passions, spend more time with him, being more affectionate, share more about my life and letting him hang out with my friends, always defending him when my parents get mad at him and stuff. \nBut I’m his sister, not a friend. It will never be the same.\nI also got other problems I’m dealing with, so I don’t know what to do and anxiety is killing me.\nThank you for reading this, I hope I explained myself :’)",

Deep buried memories I didn't know I had begin to resurface. I think about my life now as a young adult. How I don't have a social life, friends, or a job. I think about living in poverty, and if I'll ever be able to live in a clean and safe house. I think about myself, my future goals, and what my life's purpose is. \n\nI realize my dreams died long ago, and there is nothing grand I want to do with my life.

What would it be like if I died? How would people respond if I killed myself? Would it really hurt so bad to kill myself? They say death is a part of life, but that's not true. We exist for less than a fraction of the time that we don't exist. It should be 'existence is a part of non-existence.' Death is forever, life is for less than a second. Why are we even alive?

I hate myself I have been dealing with depression since 7th grade I’m now 16 turn 17 in January but I hate myself I have people over at my house friends we drink have fun I had a party at my house with a lot of kids from my school but I feel like if I didn’t do that if I didn’t have a house for people to drink in to pass out I would have no body I think I have one real friend. I come home and my anxiety gets to me fast I think did I say hi to that kid in the hallway loud enough so he heard me because he said hi to me what if he didn’t and he thinks I hate him like I egoed him what if he hates me what if what if and it goes like that it comes to the point where if I do something wrong something I regret I will think to myself well tonight I’m going to over think the fuck out of it I have other things but until I know no one I know can find this I won’t say but I hate myself today I got home and felt tired I called my dad no answer he calls me a lot I don’t answer it’s no big deal I call someone I know they answer then hang up I call my life time friends I haven’t talked to her in a while also side note I’m a guy if I haven’t said that but I called her she was like what and really wanted to rush the call and end it so I asked a dumb question to act like that’s why I called her and said bye. Sometimes I bast music in the car home loud so no one can talk to me go in my room lock the door go in my closet but headphones on and cry I cry and pull on my hair I build up my emotions and don’t know how to express them I do sports I have lots of people I think are friends I got a job recently I’ll have my own money my parents are divorced but that’s just and excuse that has nothing to do with this it’s me I’ve been suicidal most of my life but never had the balls to do it. I know I’m a bad person I hope that one day I will get caught wanting to kill myself and I’ll get on anti depressants and I’ll bring them to school and “accidentally” drop them and another kid sees them or another kid I know sees them and I get attention. My mom would say that I’m the quiet kid in my house I don’t talk much and she is shocked when she hears teachers and parents say “your kid talks non stop” she doesn’t put any thought into it. I never get to talk in my house I get cut off somewhat thrown in the back and I’ve learned to live with that roll with the punches some might say I don’t even know what I want out of this I think I just want I don’t even know maybe help if you have read this thanks sorry for the grammar it’s not my strong suit",

    "selftext": "When someone's stuck in an abusive relationship, what is the point of CBT? Or DBT, self-compassion, non-violent communication, grounding skills, journaling, codependency work, etc.?\n\nMy(32F) partner(29NB) frequently criticizes and degrades me when they're frustrated. I've asked them for kinder language, and it's gone nowhere. Actually, it's made things worse. And, for all my trying to take the hits and develop thick skin, I'm at my limit.\n\nMy self-esteem is worse than it's been in a very long time. We've been together for over 2 years. I feel all the work I've done in therapy (over 10+ years) slipping, even counting my current individual sessions. \nThere was an argument last week... and the week before that... and I'm sure another will happen in the upcoming week. I just don't see a way out. I feel the way I did when I first developed depression as a teenager.\n\nIf I spend time with them, I'm eventually degraded for things that could've been addressed with a short assertive statement (e.g. if I swipe a look at the time when they're talking). If I attempt to fulfill their requests in the relationship, I'm criticized for trying too hard. If I spend time alone, I'm leaving them alone in the relationship. Feels like my partner is Jeykll and Hyde.\n\nThey don't want couples counseling, (though they do have their own therapist). They think CBT and DBT is a form of gaslighting. Told me my journaling habit must a way I complain about not wanting to feel difficult emotions. Hates non-violent communication because it's \"inauthentic and dishonest\".  Basically just wants me to complain and scream back during conflict -- which I refuse to do.\n\nWe're financially dependent on each other; we can't strike out on our own in this housing market. No family to lean back on. No friends. We're in a small town in the middle of nowhere. If one of us leaves, then the other is (survival-wise) screwed.\n\nWhen I say I'm at my limit, I'm not suicidal. But, I'm lapsing into some alternatives to self-harm that feel like warning signs: Cold water for the dive response, slapping myself in the face, punching my legs.\nI'm even getting rage build-ups that are getting impulsive and uncontrollable. The most I do is throw my shoes on and go for a speed-walk, or start lifting weights. But the possibility of making one wrong move and speedwalking in front of an unseen car is not zero.\n\nI don't know how to end this. I guess I'll reiterate: **How on earth does anyone continue to take care of themself in this kind of environment?** Where any progress made on self-esteem/compassion/grounding/assertiveness is just blown to pieces and set back within a few hours of high-intensity conflict?\n\nGetting this off my chest. Would love advice, if any has it. I feel deeply, desperately alone. More than that, I've been given the message that it's all my fault *so often* that I believe it now. ",

Now me and her had a very mutual and easy break up we were always on good terms so nothing awkward there but I live here now with her and she is great and is a great person and I help her with her kids she helps me with mine but she is a alcoholic and I swear it is eating my soul. I was raised by two drunks and being stuck here for atleast another 6-12 months gets harder every day. When she is sober she is awesome when she is drunk she is like dealing with a geriatric person or a 5 year old. I’m hiding in the living room (she doesn’t drink when I have my son on weekends so it’s just me and her kids here now) and I can feel this just boiling my blood. I want so much better for myself and for my son.

I'd had bouts of passive suicidality before, but usually more of a \"I wish I could leave to experience peace\" more than any concrete wish of death. \n\nOne morning it just got too much, without going into detail. There was a balcony with a fairly low ledge at the hospital, and it crossed my mind to just... do it. If I died, I'd get peace, if I didn't, I'd be out in a coma long enough to rest. \n\nThen I remembered a song I was listening to a lot. It's a song by YUNGBLUD, called \"god save me but don't drown me out\" and he dedicated it to everyone feeling not enough. \n\nIt was just a split second, but I wanted to hear it, and I went to grab my phone. That was enough. I put on the song and cried. \n\nI used to have really really bad habits of injuring myself (breaking bones in some cases) to deal with pain. But now every time I feel like that, I put that song on. I cry every time. Every single time. But I haven't injured myself since, I thought of death still.

Yeah, I hated my school, I hated my teacher, she drove me into hysterics several times. In the summer I was also sad, kinda depressed, not sleeping until 5 a.m.\n\nBut I knew who I was going to be, I knew what I was going to do, and everything seemed easy. College to become an English teacher, with a scholarship. At the same time doing nails, becoming an activist, easily making friends with the whole group because I already had real friends — the rest was easy.

I keep hoping a car hits me on the way, but then my mom would yell at me if I got into an accident.\n\nAlso my eyesight dropped to -4, everyone’s mad at me about it, and I cry every single day.\nI feel SO BAD SO BAD SO BAD SO BAD.\n\nI DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO, WHO I’M GOING TO BE, HOW NOT TO BE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO MY FAMILY, WHAT I’M EVEN DOING IN THIS COLLEGE, WHY I DIDN’T GET IN, WHY IS ALL THIS HAPPENING TO ME.\n\nAnd right now I’m crying on the street ground in my “formal dress skirt longer than the knee, tight hair” and my backpack is super heavy. I have to carry a laptop, a tablet, and a bunch of notes because that’s what the teacher said, and apparently only I have to do it. My classmates are stupidly asking how to prepare for the math test tomorrow — HOW DO I KNOW, I’VE BEEN CRYING IN EVERY MATH CLASS.\n\nAnd I’m afraid to go home because my mom will yell at me for being weak and for losing my charger. What else… oh yeah, please someone make it stop, but then my mom would scold me even for being gone. (Don’t judge my mom, she’s actually perfect, I just hate my teacher, I hate my sisters, and I half hate my dad for not earning enough so my mom has to provide for all 5 of us. And my sisters are already 20 and still sitting on my mom’s neck. But yeah… I hate my life. I want to disappear.)\n\nSo yeah, I post it here just to somehow get it off my chest.  \nLoo enough with hysteric I have mast test and js rn teacher send me more docs to do",

I actually had 2 arguments with them. In the beginning, my mother started freaking out and crying. My father was screaming at me who never screams. In the second argument they were both screaming at me, they even almost started to beat me up.\n\nI just stood there. Unbothered. Looking at them calmly, directly in the eyes. Talking nothing, just standing there with a neutral expression. I didnt feel anything about my  parents worrying so much about me. I know they worried about me because they love me.\n\nWhen they noticed my expressions they started calling me insane and not mentally there. They threatened to send me to a psychiatrist or a mental anylum.\n\nYesterday my neighbour almost died. I feel terrible because I just stood there unemotionless and said to myself ok while faking concern because I don't know any better. My mother was crying.\n\nI cannot feel empathy or sympathy, no matter how hard I try to.\n\nAll people have felt love at some time. They describe it as a beautiful feeling. I haven't felt it at a single point in my life. The only thing that brings me emotion is disgust and sadness and stress and fear. I feel so empty inside. No emotions, I covered them up a long time ago. I am but a shell of a human being. I am in this depressive state because it is the only time I can feel something.\n\nDo you know what? I think I know why I cannot get up. I know why I am in this depressive and suicidal state. It's because I actually feel something. I can feel sadness and hopelesness. It makes me feel human. It makes me feel something. Otherwise my life feels empty. I feel empty inside, like an empty shell of a human. If I had a productive day and started working and trying to improve my life, that would bring me only emptiness. I want to be sad, because I actually feel sonething for once in my life.\n\nI have trouble with taking responsibility for my actions and always blame others.\n\nI have never been diagnosed with autism.\n\nMy human exerience is so different from others.\n\nI think I am becoming more insane every day.

    "selftext": "When I had my children I was not married but lived with their father.  Our time together was nothing but toxic and DV on both ends. I made the mistake of also believing that his bipolar disorder didn’t matter. He would go on binges of being unmedicated.  I left after our oldest turned about 5 and our youngest was 2. I received zero child support due to dad being in SSI. Regardless I have always made sure my children never went without . Outside of basics my children have always been in multiple extracurricular activities including horse back riding, piano, gymnastics, karate, tutoring, etc. kept up with play dates, doctors appts, parent teacher meetings you name it. \n\nWhen my oldest who is currently 9 was about 2 I asked her pediatrician if she should be tested for abnormalities based off of her behaviors that I felt were off( very clingy, attention seeking, overly talkative) and due to her dads disorders. She said no she is totally fine. At 5 I asked the same and the answer was she was normal. Matter of fact everyone said it was normal. \n\nTo add I am very introverted and grew up without siblings. I was taught to entertain myself. I was very quite growing up but did see how siblings reacted amongst each other through cousins and friends. \n\nMy daughter is the complete opposite and always is in need of attention and I am unable to offer it to her because it’s fucking exhausting. She is never satisfied. After her father, I briefly seen 2 men. She literally ruined each possible relationship for me and literally told me she does not want a stepdad. I never introduced them as partners but whenever she even sees me talking to a man she just hates it. Does not want me to be happy at all. \n\nI do not have much family where I live but we do the best we can that they know they have a village amongst ourselves. Their fathers family is not as present and they see them occasionally. They see their father once a week at this point but there has been times that they have went without due to his choice of not wanting to be bothered.\n\nI started noticing my daughter getting very disrespectful at around 6 years old. She was dealing with a lot at the time. My own father was there for me like no other and she had never had that so I do feel for her. I also blame myself for choosing her father. I briefly put her in therapy but failed to stick with it. She seemed to be getting a bit better. Yes u dropped the ball. She also started making comments about wanting to be with dad not comprehending that dad does not have her best interest. Has not showed up for parent conferences, performances, etc. I wouldn’t say he doesn’t care but he dont. \n\nAround 8 I started noticing her objection to authority. She would pretend to be an angel outside of our home but when at home was just a horrible person. I am no perfect mother but I grew up to obey and respect  the person taking absolute care for you regardless. She started lashing out at home. Playing with lotions and creams that I tell her almost every other day not to touch. Literally sneaking and stealing to the point that I do not trust her at all. The other issue is my son is starting to mimick.\n\nWhat I see her do is gaslight both her brother and myself. It’s literally like she says things to make you so angry that you lash out. She is a manipulator. At one point she started extorting by saying I will tell such and such you did this to me or I will call the police or tell the school you are abusing me. and half of it was not true. One day she told me that a teacher at school did not like me . When I picked her up I made the mistake of asking her infront of said teacher if this is who she is talking about? She was thoroughly embarrassed and then pointed her finger at me. \n3 days later DCF was knocking on  my door. I was stressed for months. \n\nI have been in and out of court for the past 8 years and half of it was to protect them especially when they were to young to talk. I feel like now their is less threat especially with how vocal my children are. The kids always says that their dad wants them to come live with him but when I asked him to take more time in court he says he doesn’t want more time and is fine with his one day. \n\nThey enjoy being with their father as well. They are enjoying him as the other parent who doesn’t HAVE to provide. This means he is able to buy candy, toys, fast food etc all in one day. They love it there. But I cannot afford nor do I want to because I take care of home.\n\nIn recent times I have been telling the children that they can go live with their father. I am so tired of the disrespectful shit at home. Slamming doors, yelling, cursing, just nasty, jumping up and down when I have neighbors, police being called because my daughter screamed that I was trying to kill her, etc.\n\nFor the past 2 weeks they have been spending the weekends at their dads house. When I picked my kids up today my daughter was in tears talking about she didn’t want to come home. Mind you I have been in his studio apartment. No bed not even a couch. They have been sleeping on the floor. But they love it there.\n\nI’m seriously tired of trying to do what’s best for them . I have done it all of their lives as I am supposed to but I’m tired of being spat on everyday. There father will give up on them in 2 weeks but they will not understand.\nI also refuse to kill myself over this stress and my children have borne expressed they hated me and to be honest I have told them the same in the past while extremely upset.\nWhat I absolutely do hate is the fact that I fucking do everything for my kids but they will probably have no respect for me at all when they are adults.\nNot going to lie but I am so fucking tired.\nI do not know what to do. I am really thinking about letting them go",

I've felt this way for a very long time. Classic case of the addict parents, childhood SA, blah blah blah. That childhood adversity quiz thing doctors sometimes have you do checked all the boxes.\nAnyway\nI've always had a hard time in life. It's always been really hard to fit in, and difficult to keep friends I do make. I can't keep a job to save my life. I'm currently homeless for the I think 6th or 7th time (I'm 25)\nI gave a long-term bf but the relationship can be highly mutually toxic at times\nI moved away from my family, and while they're not great in many ways, it has definitely contributed to my loneliness \nI feel so very deeply misunderstood and alone.\nI have been sober for a little over a year now, which has benefited me in a lot of ways, but I really do miss just being numb to the world \nAnyway, let me get to the point.  \nWhen I was 17, I was living in my own. I couldn't make ends meet and it just felt like the walls were getting progressively tighter around me at all times. I was on copious amounts of street drugs, and one night after being out for a couple of days, I shot myself in the temple. \nI remember putting the gun against my head, and sliding down the wall just sobbing. I remember barely squeezing the trigger. Then I remember waking up in agony, beyond disoriented. I crawled out of my front door and laid on my neighbor's porch step naked. I couldn't remember what clothes were, where to find them, or how to use them.\nI woke up in the hospital about 70 hours later\nAfter a lengthy stay in the hospital, and an equally long stay in the psyche ward, I was sent home \nAfter a long journey of several kinds of therapies (physical, speech, occupational, etc...) I started to feel like a sliver of myself was regained. A lot of things have changed dramatically for me since then, both positive and negative \nThat being said, I recognize how lucky I am to have survived that without drooling on myself for the rest of my life.\nNonetheless, I constantly have this nagging feeling that I wasn't supposed to make it and that I'm rly that much of a failure that I couldn't do even that right. I mean the decision to do something like that comes with such a weight of finality...to wake up from it feels...wrong\nI feel wrong. I feel like I genuinely don't have a place for myself in this world \nI am just so tired of feeling this way, and I wonder if it will ever go away\nI've been highly suicidal lately and the thought gets stronger daily. I just want to feel better or not exist. Life is hard. I try to stick it out, but overall, the older I get the farther I fall behind. I have aspirations to go to college and make something of myself, but my oat choices have left me with a severe deficiency in a lot of academic and personal areas (thankfully I can speak and write well enough) and it feels like a pipe dream at this point. I'm several thousand dollars in debt from a few attempts to better myself in that way. I just couldn't see it through. I dont know what to do anymore. I am stunted, traumatized, and significantly different than what I thought I would be when I was young and attending school for gifted children. I'm disappointed in myself. I'm like some warped version of myself and I can't stand it. I can't even look at myself in the mirror anymore. I just feel like the lights have been out for a long time...\nI guess there's no real point to this, I just kinda needed to ramble and get this off my chest.

    "selftext": "I (30sF) was diagnosed with a rare chronic disease this year and nobody told me it would affect my lifespan. I keep seeing over and over that people should 'live a normal lifespan'. This is, surprisingly, what often comes up even on Google. So this is what I have told my family and friends.\n\nBut I got curious, and I have a biology background. I was looking up possible causes for this disease in actual scientific articles, and what I have found is people *who are diagnosed over 60* are expected to have a normal lifespan. Younger people are not. Prognosis is 20-30 years. I will very likely be dead before retirement age. \n\nThis news wouldn't be so jarring, but my current quality of life is not at all where I want it to be. I'm out of work for mental health problems. I have no savings, I don't own a house, I have an unhappy living situation that makes it difficult to make progress with my mental health. Suicidal ideation is something I've struggled with a lot, and although I wouldn't go through with anything, this situation doesn't help. At best, I am halfway through my life and I'm scared that the next 20 or 30 years of it will be scraping by and struggling. \n\nI don't want to tell a single person I know. I'm quite open with medical stuff. I don't mind sharing because it often promotes awareness. But I don't want anyone to know I will not live to see my 70th birthday. I know that making it to my 60s isn't a bad age, but it is exceptionally young for my family. I also have family members with incredibly unhealthy lifestyles (part of the reason for my MH problems) who have already surpassed the age I will like reach, and that really hurts. It isn't fair. I needed more time just to heal the damage they did, and I won't get it.\n\nThe only way that I can frame this in any kind of positive way is that I really feel like I've lived a life already. I wasn't always out of work, I've done things I'm proud of and had some great experiences. If I'm optimistic and tell myself I definitely have another 30 years, then it feels like there is time to start again from scratch, earn money and have more great experiences in that time. But I can't go about it the same way I did before, because I am tired, and I have symptoms from the disease that are sometimes debilitating.\n\nI need to find a way to make the best of whatever is left of life, whether it's 10 years or 30. I can't spend it struggling. It would be such a waste. I also needed somewhere to get this off my chest. ",

    "selftext": "I just want to take some things off my chest... I've broken a dillema and now i'm kinda suffering.\n\nFirst, i want to make clear that English is not my first language and I won't be using chatgpt to maintain the whole thing \"human\", with my own words and feelings. Also, the text will probably be long so there won't be a TLDR because it's hard enough to put feelings into words, I don't want to resume them too... If you just want to know what i did and not the whole emotional baggage under it, just go to the middle-end.\n\nTrigger warning for suicide and sexual abuse, even thought it appears only briefly, you can choose to skip/not read the post.\n\nHaving said this, now I'll begin with some lore about me.\n\nDuring my childhood, my mother never gave me any love, it fucked up my head while growing up. My early teens, I went from being an intelligent kid to a failure because I was more concerned trying to survive the crippling depression I had than to study for school. My first girlfriend on the first year of HS did the favor and finished the job of fucking me up. I was manipulated, lied to, cheated on, physically and sexually assaulted by her. I was only fifteen, man... In the end, she left me truly broken.\n\nI spent the remaining of the year thinking, should i kill myself? Will I ever be loved? Will it ever get better? I barely knew feelings if they were not  numbness, anguish and deep sadness that didn't go away. I've reached the point of sleeping 15 hours a day, only waking up to go to school (there were days I didn't even go) and my relationship with my brothers and parents hit the rock bottom during this time.\n\nAfter some more humiliation during the remaining time of the year, I decided to live and fucking survive. I dragged my body out of the bed, pretented it was everything ok, studied hard, hanged out with friends and family and did everything a normal person did and... yay! I passed the finals exams. The price for fighting for my life and pretending to be ok? I got to the point where I could barely feel any emotion at all. I was only an empty husk. I could laugh, be angry or kinda sad, but, some sides that made me human weren't there anymore. I wasn't kind, I couldn't comprehend empathy anymore, I didn't felt remorse or guilt for lying or doing bad things. I also developed a profound hate and disdain for people.\n\nIt happened slowly over the course of the year and I didn't notice any of it. What mattered at the end it was that I survived, but, it had a cost. When going through trauma, there's two ways a people can go. Either they blame/take it upon themselves or the other way, they take it on other people. And that was me. Why couldn't my mother care for me like others? She is the one to blame? Why my father was a drunkard and left? He is to blame. Why did my siblings not supported me when I said I was having suicide thoughts? They are to blame. And so on. I ended up hating people and having toxic and bad thoughts by the end of it all. But, around people, I had my ways. I put on my mask, smiled and was deemed charismatic and gentle. No one ever saw through me, only she (My friend, let's call her \"R\") did.\n\nIn the second year of my HS, I met this girl, the friend in question. We hit off from the start and became friends, then, the group grew, but we were always together. She is damn pretty, not like a model, but enough for any man to think he is fucking lucky to have her by his side, also, she is a incredible person. Be it personality, character and values, she was/is really a good person. While myself... Puberty hadn't helped me, I still looked younger than I was and I didn't really cared for how I looked, only doing enough. Nowadays, I joke that I was the ugly duckling but it doesn't matter at this time.\n\nShe was not the brightest when it means to learn fast but at that time, she already had some decent knowledge about theology and philosophy that interested me. She introduced me to the classics and the bible and I helped her with math and physics mostly. At that time, I was already interested on economics and politics, read a lot of books for the past two years, so I also had a lot to share with her.\n\nWe both were poor and in public school so it was hard to find people with the same interests. That was the main reason on why we became such good friends from the start. From the start, he talked about interest and had some deep convos about a lot of things. On the first month, she were always seated in front of me with her friend.\n\nShe was truly something else in a way that I never quite understood. Everybody in the group liked her, even people from outside our classroom talked to her. On the bright side, being with her helped me strengthen my mask so I ended with a lot of friends and colleagues too, not that I minded, I was too numb to feel something, things were just how they were. A compliment or an insult felt the same, just like a 0 or a 10. It's cliché, but talking with her was the only thing that interested me at that time.\n\nEven while trying to understand how other communicated and their facial and body expressions worked, sometimes I got too focused on the conversation with her to care about trying to look like I was \"normal\" so I just stared into her green, almond eyes while listening to whatever she was saying. There was this time were she copied me and stared into my eyes like I did to hers, when I noticed, she smiled and asked if she was staring too much on a sarcastic way. We had a good laugh about this and I didn't feel embarrassed, she a way of pointing at my little inadequacies. They came like small jokes, teases or just a plain tip. She always left me wondering, how does she even knows about these things? How can she tell? Can others see how bad I'm acting too?\n\nWe got pretty close in one month and a half, already considered the other a \"best friend\". Jokes about we being in a relationship appeared but we just laughed it off and said it wasn't like that. A friend of mine, who sat at my side on the classes, asked if he could shoot his shot and I said go ahead. I felt a little bad but at that time, I couldn't tell what was exactly I was feeling about the situation.\n\nHe ended up getting rejected. The reason he tried was because he was going to change classes, so, he would never have to see her again. The next day, she was seated on my desk and I occupied the one my friend used. And this was an important moment on our relationship. Because nowadays i see that she \"abandoned\" her friend to sit by my side.\n\nWe talked a lot, about a lot of things. We studied together, did group presentations together, had lunch together and even waited for the other if one wanted to use the bathroom before going home. After about two to three months, we started to stay after the school was over just to talk. We talked, had conversations, discussions and debates. I didn't noticed how much those meant to me. My routine was really bland. I used to wake up early everyday to study for school and play on my old notebook, then, have lunch at home and head to school. After school, we used to spend 1 to 2 hours together on the school grounds before I walked her to the house she lived on and went to mine. And then, more studying or playing/watching series. And things just went like this until the mid-year break.\n\nR was going to travel with her family to the countryside, I already knew that for some time but i felt a little sad because we wouldn't be able to hang out the whole month. And this day, this month, I remember it kinda fondly. She surprised me with a hug of farewell. I didn't know what to feel but it left a warm sensation on me.\n\nThe month passed by on a blur, she was mostly unavailable during this period. I reflected a lot on our friendship and decided it would be good to open up a little.\n\nThe break was over and she, again, jumped on me to get a hug but this time i managed to reciprocate. It was nice and took a little longer than it should. I can still remeber how i felt seeing her again after just a month, and i thought, does she feel the same? The 'me' from that time got to the answer that 'probably no'. My self-steem was so low that i couldn't even consider that she may have felt the same way. There was also fear of she discovering who i truly was. How messed up i was...\n\nThat very day, on our little meeting after school, we entered on the topic of past. Yeah, it is kinda weird that we barely talked about our pasts but it was mostly because of me, i avoided the topic and she respected my avoidance.\n\nI learnt a lot about the true R that day and almost didn't manage to talk about my past because it was so painful just thinking about that. Even to this day, saying some things to myself can bring some tears to my eyes so you can imagine how was that for a barely 16 old boy.\n\nFor the most part, i managed to hold the reflex of crying but i don't know if it was the way she looked at me, how close to me and open she was, how... inviting. Words caught up on my throat, i didn't have strenght to say because there was a fight for the tears not to fall. Her hand came over mine and i kinda broke down. I didn't wept, but a lot of tears ran down my face and she hugged me really tight. I will never forget this day. It made me question for the first time if the world is not only a place for me to suffer. And more importantly, why is she doing this to me? We hugged until i stopped crying. I felt a sensation of peace i've never felt before. She have seen me, listened to me and still accepted me. It was a completely foreing feeling. The first time ever.\n\nWell, anyways, i'll start to wrap things up to get to the point. We got closer since that day. When the next year came, the first two months were great. Our hugs sometimes lasted longer and we started to touch each other more, my aversion to touch was lessening overall because of her. She was very touchy with everyone but more with me since i've 'let her in'. The COVID came and well, it fucked me. All my school plans to a sucessful path to college were thrown into hell, she went to the countryside to be together with the rest of her family and slowly we drifted apart.\n\nTwo years in solitude did a lot for me. Both good and bad. With so much free time available, i reflected on all of my past, eventually coming into terms with it. Or with whatever i could. I develop a strong self-counscious ability and it helped me analyze and see what trauma led to what behaviour that led to this and that. But the shitty thing is, only noticing won't change much. Two years in isolation made me worse than i was in some ways.\n\nI forgot how to use my mask and my abscence of feelings got stronger, that was, until another star appeared on my life, my current girlfriend. On October, we met on the internet. She was broken on her own way.\n\nI got attracted to her because she knew how to hold a conversation, she got attracted to me because i wanted to have a conversation, not see her naked. A strange start, indeed.\n\nNovember, the school made everyone go back. Two more months before the end. My relationship with my actual girlfriend only improved. Just like R, we hit off instantly. R reappeared on my life, along with all my other close friends from before. I evolved during the pandemic, i was too tired to pretend and use a mask, because of this, i was isolated during the whole two months because i was the only one of my group on the classroom.\n\nFast forward to march, i ask my girlfriend to be my girlfriend and she accepts!\n\nOn the few months that we've been together, she showed me a lot of good things. She helped me, without even knowing, get in contact with long lost emotions. I felt pity when i listened to her story. I felt empathy for the pain she suffered. I felt guilt when i made her sad. I felt all the emotions with her. It scared me a lot but also made me feel elated. I am still human.\n\nMy girlfriend is... almost perfect. She is beautiful and has a body that i love so much even though she doesn't. She is smart, maybe even more than i am. She's so fucking funny too. Since forever, she always made me feel safe and heard. We are like true soulmates, it's so weird the connection we have that it's difficult to explain.\n\nSince the end of HS, all of us drifted apart. We had our group and contacts but we rarely talked to each other. That was, until last year. R messaged me, said she and another guy from our group would hang out and asked if i wanted to. I said yes and suggested we called the others and in the end, we all had a great time. After it ended and everyone went home, when we were alone, she took my hand and started caressing it, then, she asked if we could sit somewhere and talk just like the old days. That day, nothing happened but i've come really late, past midnight. Me and R live on the same neighborhood, at this time, she didn't know i was dating a girl for almost 3 years.\n\nMy girlfriend was worried but she trusts me, i have never given her any reason to suspect me, even if i was late into the night with another woman.\n\nEventually, i told R i was dating, she was happy for me.\n\nMe and the group hanged out more, so did me and R. We always stayed after to talk by ourselves but this time, no innapropiate touches. After these moments, i always got home with a weird feeling on my chest. I even visited her home a few times. There were months that almost every saturday or sunday i spent an afternoon on her home. Not alone, her parents and sisters were there. They are really good people and i ended getting close to them too.\n\nNOW! We can get to the shit part.\n\nShe's have been on my mind lately, more than i would like to admit. We send each other videos on instagram. We talk the whole day through messages and audios even while working. Without even noticing, i have been drawn to her again. We work nearby, sometimes we even encoutered each other while going home. We are always friendly to each other but, i'm not a teen anymore, i can feel the underlying tension.\n\nI am rational and ruthlessly pragmatic, two things my girlfriend warns me about, to not be so rigid. So, why did i give her space to enter? Why do i let her affect me? I know she notices how restless i get around her and i know she likes it. She tries to act innocent but we aren't teens anymore.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we were on her house, again. This time, unlike any other, her sisters weren't home and her mother was upstairs, sleeping. We were seated close to each other but not enough for it to be innapropriate. Discussing some weird conspiracy theory we saw the other day when from nowhere she starts bringing the past. How we were and all that. Her eyes, they never changed, my favorite part of her. The way they looked at me, what did they see?\n\nThe conversation took a strange turn, she basically admited that she was in love with me back in the day. I was flabbergasted.\n\nHow? Why? How?\n\nIt was the first time on my life that i saw her blushing, she is white, so it got pretty apparent. And it was here that i let my guard down. I don't know the fuck why i said that. I said that eventually, i noticed that my feelings at that time were also love but i was too inexperienced and scared to see and admit. Her expression changed, she smiled and got closer asking for more. For details and such.\n\nWhile we talked, the vibe was weirdly intimate, and she asked if these feelings still existed, and she teased me, saying they still do.\n\nAnd i said... 'Yes. I never really stopped loving you'. I didn't thought about it, just flew out of my mouth. Her expression was one of surprise before turning into happiness. She asked me for confirmation but at this point i noticed the shit i've got myself into. She got close, fast, and i swear time slowed down a little. I saw her coming and closing her eyes and in this brief moment, i got sober and turned my head. She ended kissed my cheek. I got up, told her it would be better if i go home and went away.\n\nWhat made me win against these fucking emotions? Plain thinking. I'm so grateful for myself for not listening to my destructive feelings.\n\nIt's simple... Why would i exchange the stability that i have with my girlfriend for a maybe with someone else? I already have someone that i am ready to spend the rest of my life, why would i even think of sacrificing this for a MAYBE?\n\nSure, R is an amazing person and i can picture a good future with her, but, reality has a way of twisting our lives. What i have with my girlfriend came with a lot of disagreements, fights and meeting on the middle ground. She know my good, my bad and my ugly. She knows everything about me, if there's someone that ever got close of knowing who i REALLY AM, it is my girlfriend. She accepts me the way i am. And even if i have problems with feeling remorse for my actions, i actually feel like ass now.\n\nR is in love with me, but would she accept me? Every little thing? The bad parts? The dark thoughts? The bad days? The consequences of my past? All of my desires that are now fullfiled? Would she make me laugh like my girl does? Would she fight for me like my girl does?\n\nWhy did i acted like i was... available?\n\nSince that day, me and R didn't talk much, but we'll meet to discuss this, not on her house btw. But she does not leave my mind. I think about her during the day, and night. I dream with her on the most different scenarios. If she wasn't christian, i would certainly think she did some witch craft to make me in love with her.\n\nWhat i am feeling is intense. I don't know how to explain and i feel bad about it. I don't want to cheat on my girlfriend even though most of what i've done already configures as cheating. But when i think of R, i can't help but imagine ourselves kissing and together, but i don't actually want that.\n\nMy girlfriend saved me, and i saved her. She tells me she doesn't know what she'll do if i ever leave her live or i die. How could i leave her? How could i cheat her? This is how i will repay the kindness she gave me? At the end, i'm just another asshole just like everyone that fucked me up during my life?\n\nI don't know, really. This shit will die with me. If these feelings don't go away, i won't even meet R. I will just talk things out on the phone and slowly vanish away from her life. My girlfriend will never know about this, no one ever will. I hope that if on the future, she goes through the same as me... that she choses me, just like, two weeks ago, i chose her.\n\nIf anyone read to the end, well, thank you. I just wanted to take it out of my chest. I can't talk about this with anyone. I know some things looks empty or disconnected but it's because there a lot of details and i tried a lot to compress things to really put weight on everything and not just seem like she's just a special girl from my past. R was the first person who talked to me, befriended me, saw me, helped me, hugged me and that i cried in front of. This shit is not easy to leave behind.\n\nI hope in another universe, me and R are leading a happy life. Unfortunately for her, in this one, she was too late.",

    "selftext": "Long story short, I’ve been with my (17F) girlfriend (17F) for over two years. Upon entering the relationship, we were both in very bad places physically and mentally. We sort of fed off of each others pain and once we both went to different schools, I wanted to better myself so that both I and we could have a positive future together. She wanted the same and we both began our journeys. She, however, comes from a strict Sri Lankan household which has made her journey to happiness a lot trickier. They have left her with many needs unmet and previously I was “able” to help mend those gaps. As of now however, she’s failing school and suicidal and I am doing well both mentally (ish) and academically. It almost feels like nothing has changed on her end at times. I cannot emphasise the lengths I have gone to in the past just to console her and be there for her. However…I am tired. And it feels deeply unfair to say I am almost angry at her for not being 100% okay by now. While things have gotten better in terms of her eating disorder and such, and I acknowledge her achievements often - she is still in a very dark place. She misses class because she can’t face it, she self harms and she cries pretty much every day if not multiple times a day. I try and console her each and every time and put on a brave face. I worry that I have become too tired to deal with this anymore, as almost every conversation we have drains me as it is usually negative. I have become short tempered and impatient with her, and it often results in her being very upset and me feeling incredibly guilty and apologetic. I love her deeply, and will continue to stay by her side, but I always wonder if she is holding me back. I cancel plans because something always seems to happen with her. I put off study because she’s upset. (I could just be making excuses) I can be very empathetic and her pain is mine. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I almost feel evil for wanting to be away from her at times. Everything in her life is almost rigged to make it worse and it feels comedic at this point and I don’t want to be angry but it’s just impossible.\n\nFor some context of her, she is super supportive and lovely. She loves me very very much and I love her too. Just mentally exhausted.",

    "selftext": "I've been out of state visiting my boyfriend for a few months. Last month we went out drinking together and I drank way over my limit. I got alcohol poisoning, was throwing up everywhere and was shaking and throwing up the next morning. After helping me clean up my boyfriend left for work and once I felt better I decided to take a pregnancy test. I don't know why but I just had this feeling in my gut that I needed to. I thought it'd come back negative but it was positive. I didn't know what to do. I had just been to the hospital before I visited my boyfriend and was struggling with the medical bills. I didn't wanna go back again to hear what I already knew. I didn't tell anyone. I waited and a few days later I passed through a big and painful \"blood clot\". I've started drinking and smoking everyday since then. I can't stop thinking about how I could've just gone to the hospital. I would've paid off the bills eventually. I could've told my boyfriend he deserves to know. But i just can't man. I feel so ashamed that my reckless took away what could've been mine. I've always wanted kids and this could've been my chance to start. I haven't talked to any of my family, friends and have been ghosting my Sargent.  I'm supposed to be joining the military but now I just wanna die. I have no urge to continue my training and have gained so much weight since this happened. I feel like a shell of who I used to be. My suicidal tendencies have come back full swing and I've started cutting over my cat scratches so they're less obvious. It's been about 2 months since this has happened. I still think about it everyday. I'm supposed to go home this weekend and continue my training but I can't. I wanna stay here but I know I can't. I wanna tell my Sargent I can't continue but don't wanna say why. After months of ignoring his calls and messages how can I face him. How can I face anyone. I know if I go back to my home state I'll fall apart but I have no other choice. I feel like I'm overreacting since I wasn't too far along but I just can't help but grieve. I don't know what to do with myself anymore.",

    "selftext": "Lately I (24M) have been struggling to find the will to continue my life.\n\nI work ~30 hours a week at my day job and make the other ~40% of my income through playing live music with many different bands, averaging 1-3 gigs a week. All things considered, I am usually \"on the clock\" a little over 40 hours a week. \n\nI am having a hard time coming to terms with work consuming so much of my life. If I had to be at my day job 40+ hours a week I might just go ahead and kill myself. I barely feel like I have enough free time as is. I feel ungrateful, too, because I have a fine, flexible job (I work at a small business with a cool owner). It's really not a bad job, I just have zero enthusiasm for any part of it. All I think about when I'm there is how much I want to go home, and half of what I think about at home is how much it's going to suck to wake up tomorrow to go to work again. My life revolves around waiting for the weekend, which feels so damn short every single time.  Sundays are sad. And half the time, I'm busy my whole Saturday because I'm driving somewhere far away to play for money. \n\nMy ultimate goal in life is to make a comfortable living with music. I am at a level where, for where I am located, I am one of the better instrumentalists around and I get consistent work. Problem is, I have zero energy to practice and get better, or to make my own music in my free time (which, in theory, I'm passionate about). Spending hours a day doing shit I don't like just takes so much out of me that I feel mentally dead every day when I get home, and I don't have the energy to do anything that takes more work, like practicing or making my music. So I just sit there and stagnate and think about getting better and improving my situation without actually doing anything. \n\nI believe I have been dealing with passive suicidal ideation. I do not want to kill myself, and I am not going to kill myself, but I sometimes think about how everything would be easier if I were dead. When I'm driving to work in the morning, I often think I wouldn't mind if I were in an accident and killed instantly. Because, what the fuck am I even living for? Fleeting moments of happiness? Is that all life is about?\n\nAll that said, I have it better than most people. I only spend 30 hours a week at my job and I get to do something cool for the rest of my workweek. Most people work worse jobs than I have for longer hours. I am in a great relationship with a woman I love.  So, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I so dissatisfied? I am still young and have only been in the workforce for a couple years (I finished college with a master's degree in music two years ago). I don't know how long I can stand my life the way it is now. I could see myself becoming legitimately suicidal in the future if I keep going down this road. \n\nThanks for listening. ",

    "selftext": "I'm Chinese and I decided to use a translator considering my level of English, so please forgive me if there is any reading that doesn't make sense.\n\nI am 23 years old, just graduated from university, female, with moderate depression, living at home for two months, and have been painting and preparing my portfolio while trying to cope with my relationship with my parents. From a very young age I recognized that my life was full of pain. It was interspersed with domestic violence, school bullying and all sorts of social problems. I started thinking about suicide at age 11, committed my first suicide at 13, and was diagnosed with depression at 14.\n\nI lived in a toxic and unstable family, my father was twenty years older than my mother, they divorced when I was three, my mother left him and took me back to her mother's house, then went back to him because she had to raise me etc. But my father was a very child-hating man, and he also abused my mother a lot, and during my childhood he used to pinch and pinch me on purpose in all sorts of ways, threatening to hurt me, and at the same time describing and demonstrating in great detail in front of me how he would kill my mother, and he even had a hammer, and demonstrated to me how he would knock my mother to the ground with one blow of the hammer. I was about 5 or 6 years old at the time and was very frightened and didn't know why my father was doing this, my mother knew but was powerless to stop it as she had no financial means and was dependent on my father to be able to co-parent the children. This later developed into if I had pets then he would abuse my pets in front of me, he would describe to me in equal detail how he was going to abuse them and again I had no idea how to respond. Once he even took a pair of scissors and cut the flesh off the belly of the dog I had simply because he wanted to cut its hair, and after he realized what he had done, he immediately turned and walked away, leaving the mess to me, who was only 14 at the time. I was horrified, while he looked unconcerned and said to just go get some ointment.\n\nAs I got older, by the time I was an adult, I was taller than my father. Even among women my age, I was one of the rare tall ones, and perhaps this made my father realize that he could no longer threaten me with violence. But he turned to psychological violence as well as financial threats, and if I chose not to obey he would beat around the bush with sarcasm or threaten me with not paying my living expenses and school fees until I obeyed him.\n\nMy father wasn't just one of the reasons that destroyed my past life, my mother hurt me just as much, she had an over-attachment to me, I expressed in my childhood that when I grew up I wanted to be in a room by myself and sleep apart from her (our house only had two bedrooms and I slept in the same bed as my mother), she laughed and said then she'd just take an axe and chop down the door to get in, I was horrified but I think that sums it up pretty well Everything she's done to me since then.\n\nShe is very good to me, loves me and has a lot to give materially and emotionally in me, but she is so traumatized by her own trauma and unfortunate marriage that these things stack up and cause her to be very controlling and prone to overreacting, and I'm forced to be a dumpster fire of emotions for her and she expresses her inability to comprehend and alarm at any of my emotions because she's incapable of coping with them and just runs away from them. Again, it hurt me a lot. Then during my college years she started dating on dating apps but found a booty call, and during that period then the whole person started to change drastically, I don't know how to describe it in English but she seemed to have fallen in love, obviously the other person was only in a physical relationship with her but she started describing the details of her sex life to me, intentionally or unintentionally flaunting it, and I felt devastated, and after explicitly stating that I didn't love to hear about it she continued to insist on bringing it up to me over and over again, and I Had to prepare for exams while dealing with a conflict with a friend, while dealing with her being used as an on-call free prostitute (she was even proud of it), and being sexually harassed on another social media app (yes, I dealt with that for her too).\n\nSo to summarize, you should be able to see what a crazy and twisted atmosphere my family is. And the main reason I'm feeling lost and confused right now is because my parents have been financially stabilized with my adulthood until now that I've graduated, and they seem to have become a lot more normal, they're no longer as abusive as they were in the past, and they don't fight each other or anything like that. At a glance, we're even kind of close to a normal, normal family. It made me feel out of place, but I was actually still in constant conflict with my family.\n\nI can even feel that they care about me and love me, but I have trouble accepting that. All the years of hurt, and even now, have caused me to lose trust in them, and I keep a distance from them, but as soon as we get close to each other, we are instantly at each other's throats. The fact that I suffer from depression hit my mother hard, she was very unappreciative at first, thinking that I was just too fragile, even when I showed her that I had suffered from school bullying for 6 whole years as well as prolonged domestic violence. She insisted that my father loved me and also gave me a lot of financial support and that maybe he wasn't a good father, but he did care about me. I say I understand all of that, but all of that abuse and hurt is still there and I have to deal with it alone because my mother has always shied away from these situations with me and she hates my father. Living under one roof now is just a necessity because the house is my father's.\n\nMy mother is trying to understand and accept me for what I am, her attitude towards me ranges from “you're too fragile” when I was bullied as a child and had mental problems, to “you're depressed and that's why you're so conflicted and emotionally unstable with us all the time”. She seems to think I'm some kind of broken thing that needs to be fixed, and she's trying to learn more because she wants to be able to communicate with me. But the problem is that she still has a hard time changing he easily stressed attitude, when I try to talk to her, even if I just say it normally and calmly, and even ask her ahead of time if she wants to listen. She will suddenly become agitated and start talking heatedly right afterward.\n\nIt's been two months since I arrived home after graduation, and even though I've been trying to calm her down and listen to her emotions, she hasn't been able to reciprocate, and in fact she's become more dependent on me for emotional value because of my behavior, which has made me kind of shy away from her. In yesterday we had another big fight and I feel like it's not that she can't, but that she doesn't want to understand , she interrupted what I was going to say before I could say it, and proceeded to add her own subjective additions to what I hadn't said - not at all what I was going to say! She was being preachy and I was angry but kept my emotions in check, my first thought was that I was expecting too much from her again, that she was not capable of understanding in her own right, and that I had been forcing her to try to make her understand simply because I was a pathetic guy who couldn't find anyone to listen to me for a while.\n\nBy the end of the day, our relationship still hadn't quite warmed up, I interrupted her as she was babbling at me about what I was going out to do next and told her I was dealing with my emotional lows and wasn't in the mood to listen, she tried to listen to how I was feeling but I had lost my trust in her. So turned around and went back to my room. I somehow just feel exhausted, my mother treats me like a mother and a husband, and while she's been trying to find a husband who can bring her happiness, listen to her, provide sex and financial support all at the same time, I seem like a transitional replacement. She keeps saying she's worried about me being at home and not going out to work, she's retiring so she needs a husband to provide financial support and has been on blind dates for the last year, while I think she might as well buy the lottery a few more times and rely on a man who is just being held in a position of power over her life and death. My father is a prime example of this, he would control my mother's finances by not giving her money or even making her go spend her own money before coming to him for reimbursement to make sure she didn't leave him. But my father lost his mind when he found out that my mother wanted someone else, he insisted that it was because she was a womanizer that their relationship broke down, but he was the one who was irresponsible and abandoned me and my mother in the first place. He has been unwilling to take responsibility for his family and even came to me for advice on pursuing a girl twenty years his junior when I was fourteen.\n\nI feel like I lack love, my mother keeps saying she lacks love and needs me to love her, while I feel like I don't have enough love for myself, so why should I love her? I feel like I have no one to rely on, no one to listen to me, my perception of happiness has decreased, I feel useless, I feel like no one loves me or cares about me, I want to kill myself but I'm depressed, I've always wanted to end my life even though I've felt like I needed it since a long time ago. My father has said it's because of me that he and my mother are having a hard time and have to make money to support the family, which led to me feeling like a burden from a very early age.\n\nI wasn't surrounded by many sane people and I felt like I was just trying to stay sane. Curled up in a ball, I had trouble sleeping at night. My parents have learned to care for me now and aren't as hard on me, my father even told me that I could talk to him and that he was willing to listen, which scared me because he's always been nothing but a big talker, and he'll fall on his sword if he sees you're sad. He was miserable in his own life, so he had to make those around him as miserable as he was. I keep a hammer at the end of my bed in case one day he pops into my room again to try and threaten me.\n\nHaving said all that, it's all there about myself, and I realize that I want to die in part because I don't have the ability to change things right away, and I've actually been wanting to escape, and I'm making preparations to do so. In the last year out of state my mother has been given a house that I can go over and live in, but until then I better save up some money. I'm feeling exhausted, and after all this talk, I thank you all for wanting to read this, it's probably just a small part of my crazy life. I hope I can feel pure joy again, and hopefully relax, I've been tight for many years, struggling to survive for a long time.\n\n补充：Just in case you're curious, my mother is no longer in contact with the booty call, and before that she used to spend the night at each other's places and come back in the early hours of the morning to make me breakfast, which was embarrassing for me, and embarrassing for my father. But she turned to being in the middle of a blind date.",

I am already low contact and will maintain so and just try remember that her personal struggles with me don’t necessarily translate into a wider lack of ability to empathise with or care about those struggling with mental illness. My personal view is that she does have quite low genuine care or empathy for people with serious mental illness especially when this manifests itself in any type of less-than functional behaviour. But in general the whole notion of ‘exercise so that you aren’t suicidal any more’ does carry somewhat of a ‘bootstraps’ sting to it anyway, so possibly the whole thing is it entirely on-brand. \n\n\nThe responses here have really warmed my heart and made a hard time easier so I want to thank everyone.",

    "selftext": "28yo. I have been addicted to amphetamines for nine years now. Over the course of that time I cannot say I have been truly happy. Indeed, I have been through some very dark moments. Hospitalizations, overdose scares. After a particularly trying time four years ago I swore to myself I would use responsibly and not abuse it any more.\n\nSince then I had come to find a job I really and truly loved, the first time in my life I ever experienced something like that, and someone who came to be the love of my life. I continued to use during this period and I feel like, emotionally and spiritually, there was still a lot wrong with me. I was continuing to abuse drugs and engage in self destructive habits. Regardless though, I had this job and this one particular person there with me who made my life worth it. I did feel guilty about continuing to abuse drugs and engage in other habits while with them (the job and the person) but they were among the few bright spots of my life.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I lost both of those things irreparably. I won't say exactly what happened or what I did, not yet at least, but, suffice to say, outside of doing something illegal, it could not have been more shameful or dishonorable. I resigned from my job for today and have come to face the fact I will never see the person I love again. The worst part?\n\nI have nobody to blame but myself.\n\nMy actions and some of the vile things I was doing came to the light....actions and things that stemmed from my drug addiction. I am fairly certain that, if I had not been using drugs, I would not have engaged in such things and this fallout would never have happened. These amphetamines truly turned me into a bad person.\n\nSo now, here I am again, with nothing. I had done so well at my job, and had acquired such a loved and trusted reputation...now I am leaving in dishonor and as a pariah. Even worse than that is that one person I cared so much about....now I know I will never see them again. Even the time I had with them was tainted by dishonesty, drugs usage and betrayal....it could have been so much better and THAT, perhaps just as much as never seeing them again, will always torment me.\n\nPeople will tell me to move on....people will talk about \"rock bottom\" and \"coming back up again.\" Could I? I don't know....perhaps. By right now, I feel as if I don't even want to. After what I have lost I don't even feel the attempt to try and get back anything ever again. A large part of me doesn't even want to; I feel like fully embracing self destruction and just fading away. I will never achiever again what I had before. For the first time in my life I am feeling genuinely suicidal.\n\nAnd NO, I am not throwing a pity party, I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I fully earned where I am at and feel as if in my position suicide is in fact the most natural and logical response to what I have done, what I have lost and what I have become. \"Permanent solution to a temporary problem\" but sometimes the problem is not temporary or is so much it permanently mars your future.\n\nWhere do I go from here? I have no idea...but I know I can never get back what I have lost, the two solid foundations I had. I don't believe I can find someone else, I don't want to get a new job, I don't want to do anything. My only goal for right now is to try and survive the rest of this year...though I don't even know why I should do that.\n\nNeedless to say....I have been severely depressed since then and have actually been considering leaving permanently. People keep telling me to get a new job, things will get better...but this was a serious blow. I am in physical pain I am feel so miserable. ",

    "selftext": "Pretty massive trigger warning for CSA, abuse, and suicidal ideation. Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI (22FtM) do want to start off by saying that I am relatively safe right now, just kind of emotionally spiraling and struggling to figure out where to turn for help. I’ve been sexually, physically, and emotionally abused at different points throughout my life, starting when I was a child. I ended up developing some pretty severe mental health issues because of it, maybe most predominantly complex PTSD and a dissociative disorder. Because my dissociative disorder put up amnesia blocks around a lot of it, I struggled for years with self esteem, self harm, disordered eating, and extreme attachment issues without ever being able to place why or when I started to feel like this. A couple years ago in 2022, I suffered another traumatic event that just sort of opened the floodgates on what always felt like was just sitting beneath the surface; I was molested and assaulted starting pretty young, and that set me up for a lot of repeated abuse down the line. I spent about a year and a half in a really fragile state, made worse by the recent trauma and stress I was facing and a really dysfunctional relationship, even though my flashbacks were admittedly pretty vague and didn’t make a lot of sense (I assume because of my age.)\n\nI did eventually get better, and have been working hard to keep my life on track and keep myself safe. I’m in a very healthy, loving relationship with my boyfriend of almost 1 year now. He knows what happened to me because I felt he should know what he was getting into if he wanted to be in a relationship with me, and he has been very gentle and kind with me even though he has a hard time understanding how my brain works sometimes. But I don’t really make a point to elaborate on details, mostly because I don’t really have the ability to recall them on a day to day basis, and I feel like I don’t have anybody to talk to about what’s happening, because I’m so ashamed I can’t even bring myself to talk to my therapist about it.\n\nI’m not totally sure what’s brought this on, but I started to get very vivid, intense flashbacks of things recently. I do have a therapist who’s trained in NARM and Internal Family Systems therapy that I’ve been exploring parts work with. It’s a kind of woo-hoo modality, but it’s been genuinely enlightening for me to make sense of and learn to work through a lot of my paranoia and poor coping mechanisms- I’ve been clean of a lot for a while now, probably the longest period of progress I’ve ever had. But all of a sudden, I just keep getting reminded of a lot of really horrible things. And it’s gotten to the point where it’s almost uncomfortable to not relapse and re-trigger myself. I feel like I’m chasing after reenacting and reliving my trauma, despite how sick and disgusted I feel after the fact. I keep looping back on how much worse I used to be and find myself falling into old habits and urges that I thought I was done with. I feel so angry with myself, like I’m throwing away so much progress for… what? To feel worse?\n\nI don’t think I can talk to anybody in my life about this. I’m terrified of making my boyfriend scared or losing him because of this. I don’t want to overwhelm him or anybody else. I don’t want to end up in a hospital because people think I’ll do something stupid. My life is pretty okay right now, all things considered. I have a really strong support system. I don’t talk to my family anymore, and I miss them, but I’ve done a lot better for myself now that they’re not in my life. I’m finally going back to school, for something I’m passionate in and excited for. I don’t think I want to die about this or anything. But I get this weird feeling of nostalgia around my traumatic experiences when they come up. I want to go back to not knowing anything about the things I’ve been through, but I don’t think that’s a box that can really be closed after it’s opened.\n\nI just need to externalize this. I have a lot more bubbling inside me right now, but I don’t think it’s really helpful to get into any specifics- I think that’s just enabling the problem. If you read all of this, thank you. I really just don’t know how to get this out of my head.",

    "selftext": "I cheated and it (obviously) destroyed my life.\n\nI don’t even know what to say. I just need it off my chest I guess. I dated a boy from 8th grade until the end of our first semester of college. I was so deeply in love with him, he was so sweet, thoughtful, we cried together for days on end when he moved for college. Him leaving was one of the hardest things I ever had to accept. The distance was so hard, I visited him but we fought a lot because I am so jealous. We were best friends even longer, we became best friends in 6th grade and we were just so close. Around november, I met some guy online, and I caught feelings for him and went behind my exes back and grew really close with this guy. I knew this was so wrong, I didn’t even tell the new guy that I had a bf. The new guy found out, I panicked, told my ex that i found someone else OVER TEXT after a 5 year relationship. The next day we gave eachother our shit, I cried, he cried, and that was it. I blocked him, we never spoke again. My friends told me to apologize, but I didn’t. Why not? because the new guy was monitoring me 24/7 since I lied to him. I wanna say, the new guy love bombed me, he manipulated me, he controls me, he’s 24 and i’m 19, but this is 100% all my fault and i’m not trying to deflect blame. He has all my social media passwords, he goes through my phone, he monitors my every move and would NOT allow me to contact my ex. At the time I had rose colored glasses and i think i just didn’t want to be alone. Now im starting to see what a piece of shit the AP is so not only is the guilt that has been completely crushing me since it happened getting worse (I knew from the beginning I was throwing away something I would never get back or be able to replace but I also knew the relationship couldn’t be salvaged if i caught feelings for the AP) but i’m also kind of trapped in this shitty relationship that i’m miserable in. I want to reach out so badly to my ex and just say i’m sorry, that i really hope he’s happy, just say anything, but I know that will more likely than not just open wounds again, since it’s been 8 months since we broke up. I completely removed myself from his life with almost no warning. What i did to him was honestly fucking evil. Now i’m in a relationship with a piece of shit bum who treats me like shit and I just want to be single and on my own and learn how to be alone and happy but I feel like I need an escape plan. I fucked up my own life so bad. I have no friends because most of them dropped me when I cheated on my ex and any of the friends I have left the new guy isolated me from them all and now I have no one and i’m miserable and my bf/abuser/whatever the fuck has made threats to me if we break up and i just don’t know what the fuck to do. I have therapy for the first time tomorrow. I don’t know what the fuck to do. I wish I got the chance to say sorry to my ex so badly. He was my best friend for almost 8 years. If he sees this, he will know. If you’re reading, I’m so sorry I hurt you. You look happy now. I hope the partying isn’t to cope and that you’re truly happy. I think of you and grieve what we had every day. You will always be the person who taught me how to love. I’m sorry I was a coward. I’ve accepted that living with this guilt and changing is the consequences of my actions. I know everyone is going to be rude to me because cheaters really do deserve the worst, and I got what I deserved. I am truly miserable, suicidal, and this past 8 months have been the worst of my entire life. ",

Even if I wanted to hold someone’s hand, my body would lock up. For years, I avoided eye contact, avoided walking on the same side of the street, even felt sick if there was accidental touch. My head was always down. Those nights when you open your eyes and felt fever with mild smile and high...\n\nI never liked therapy it felt like paying someone to act mechanical.

I went to my docter and am now on a waitinglist for help.\nBut it keeps getting worse. All the progress I made in the last 5 or 6 years is starting to go backwards. My panic attacs are getting worse and I have a hard time staying positive.\n\nA few days ago I went to a book market. Once a year I do this with my partner and since last year my best friend joins too. This year tho, I got so sick, a combo of panic attacs and my body just having me. So I had to leave really early and left them alone for the rest of the day to sell their stuff. \n\nI know this really hurt my friend. We dont see eachother often and now she was alone, doing something she only does to see / help me. \n\nShe has just started recovering from a really bad burnout. And where I do know it's not something I can controle. I still feel guilty for not stopping it from happening to her too. I was forced to watch her go trough the same thing that I had. And to see her starting to fall apart. So I did what I could. I tried to entourage her to go after her Dreams, listend to her and gave advise if I could. And was just there for her as much as I could. But still... \n\nThere is so much more I wish I could do. I cant go a day do something fun with her, activitys need to be altered for me to join. I cant even stay a full evening for her birthday couse I get so overwhelmed I start to panic and get migrains. I feel like the worst friend ever. \n\nNow her fiance thinks it is best for us to put a bit of distance between us. Hé is really scared that I will drag her down in my depression. And the truth is. That happening is my worst fear. The voice in my head, that I have been trying to ignore has started screaming. Couse, its one thing to ignore a voice you know just wants to put you down. Its something completely different when someone on the outside tells you that voice is correct. \n\nWe used to tell eachother everything. And now I dont know where I stand. I dont know the rules anymore. Do I start masking more around her again? Am i going to pretend to be oke and just not try to do things i know probably will go wrong anyway? Should I rip the bandaid off and tell her I need space, so I wont take her down with me?\n\nMy heart phisically hurts thinking about losing her. But the idea of me being the reason she will get back to that dark place again. Joining me in my dispair. It kills me. If it would be best for her, I would do almost anything. \n\nAm I selfish for wanting to be there when she makes her Dreams come true, lives the live she deserves and be the amazing woman I know she can be. Even when I know the chance of me ever being able to stand beside her, making my own Dreams a reality will probably never happen. \n\nShould I just finaly come to terms with my limitations and stop trying so damn hard. \n\nI am just so tired. I have been fighting so hard for as long as I remember to just be good enough. To battle my demons and finaly be able to enjoy life without having to miss everything becouse of my fear, my health, my depression, my traumas just everything. \n\nKnowing I am now also making her life worse... I just can't handle it. 12 years ago I promiced her I would never try to kill myself again. And for the first time since that day... the thought of breaking that promice went trough my mind. I am a horrible person. ",

    "selftext": "The facts are these: I had a bit of a personal reckoning in May of this year. For months, possibly years beforehand, I was pushing off a little suicidal ideation that devolved into active planning. I had resigned myself to it, and was embracing it; I looked forward to it as though I was a child counting down the days until Christmas. The thought of it awarded me a sense of indescribable peace at the time. I knew no one would really understand, and those closest to me would (justifiably) resent me for going through with it. That crossed my mind often. I didn't mind.\n\nThere was a turning point that struck me like a bolt of lightning. I won't go too deep into it, but I was away on vacation, contemplating the end, and then a dream I put down in childhood called to me. I hit the ground running the moment I got back, and here I am several months later: an entirely new person.\n\nI still look at the state of the world with disgust and dismay. I still see injustice everywhere I turn, and I can't see it getting any better for anyone. The state of the planet and the proclivities of select people on it fill me with such dread; the void still calls. But for myself, I've found a way to make my own interior world, and the world directly around me, quite beautiful. Many honest and productive conversations with myself have led to a kind of growth I never knew I could experience, and I put in the work every day to continue to find things to keep the fire burning.\n\nIt's been quite wonderful. Through this new outlook, however, has come vast waves of change. I feel as though I've catapulted myself forward at an incredible speed, and the things that cannot come with me, or those that cannot keep up, are all falling away behind me. Some of it is helping. I can let go without grievance. It's the people I held dear no longer fitting with me that I can barely stomach.\n\nI don't want to forsake relationships that meant something to me at one time or another; I still care for those people and wish the best for them. What has become resoundingly clear to me, however, is that the life I'm living now, and the person I am becoming, has sort of evolved past the need for those connections. I feel terrible for it; I sometimes feel arrogant, despite logically recognizing that people simply grow apart and seasons of life are bound to wax and wane. I have friends and a partner that I do genuinely and sincerely want nothing but good for, but those connections were made at a time when I was at the bottom of the well, looking up. Now, at the surface, I can't pull them up with me.\n\nHow conceited does it sound if I tell someone I want to break up because \"I have a new lease on life, and I can't fit you into it\"? I've tried my best to be present and to find new reasons to fall in love, but when another person is still stuck in their own rut and doesn't want to begin the climb out of it, I don't know what to do. They've expressed to me that I feel like a different person to them and that they don't like it; I understand why, but I feel more secure and I enjoy paying attention to what my mind needs to function correctly.\n\nThere is a part of me that does want to just let everything go while I continue to pursue what makes me happy. I'd like to continue to turn inward and focus on myself, my passions, and making new friends who feel more aligned with the view of life I have now. Abandoning old connections makes me feel like a horrible person, but I know they're done. Does that make any sense?",

    "title": "My ex accused me of sexual assault months after saying I made her feel safe. I lost everything.",
    "selftext": "TLDR at the bottom. I don’t know where to begin. I’m 23 now, and this past year has been the most confusing and fucked up time of my life. I’ve kept quiet, tried to move on, tried to be the bigger person, but lately I’ve just been feeling like I’m going to explode if I don’t say something.\n\nI was in a serious relationship for over a year with this girl I genuinely loved. It was the kind of relationship where we cooked together, studied together, lived together at one point. I still believe there were good parts between us after everything that happened.\n\nWe broke up last year. It was messy emotionally, but still respectful. She said she still loved me but not in the same way anymore. That night, she sent me a 10-minute long voice message. I haven’t heard her voice since. In it, she mentioned I was her safe place to come back to at night, she literally told me that I had changed for the better. That I was a good person with good intentions, just someone who sometimes expressed himself the wrong way. She apologized for being distant. Told me she still loved me. That I shouldn’t beat myself up. And most importantly she never mentioned anything even remotely close to sexual assault. She asked for no contact and said maybe we’d talk again in six months.\n\nFast forward a few months, and I find out she’s been telling people I sexually assaulted her. Apparently, she told people that during some play fighting, I gave her a hickey and didn’t stop. That shook me. Because while I didn’t stop initially the moment she used the safe word, I did stop. Immediately. No hesitation, and then I apologized for it instantly too, and she said it wasn’t a big deal. It wasn’t even sexual it was literally just us messing around like we always did. And after the fact, she messaged me and told me she didn’t hold anything against me. Again, I have that in writing.\n\nI didn’t even find out about this accusation directly. I started noticing my friends and mutual friends were distancing themselves from me. Some of them blocked me. The same people who had my back during the breakup, who called her a bitch, toxic and who told me I could do better ghosted me. And when I finally heard the rumor, I couldn’t believe it. The police told me I wasn’t in any trouble. They told me there was no case against me, no charges, nothing. Just that I should stay away from her, even though legally I could reach out if I wanted to. Which was strange but I complied and never reached out.\n\nAnd then I found out she was hanging out with my friends. The same ones who supported me. One of them my ex-best friend (let’s call her B) invited my ex to a group project session for a course that B and I were in. My ex isn’t even in our program. She has no reason to be there. If I had shown up that day which I almost did I could’ve accidentally broken the no-contact advice the police gave me. And then what? Would she have gone to the cops again? Why is she even putting herself in the same spaces she knows I have to be in for school?It honestly feels like she wants me to get in trouble.\n\nAnd I genuinely tried to give her the benefit of the doubt at first. I thought maybe she did feel assaulted and was just dealing with it in her own way. Maybe it wasn’t personal. But now? I don’t buy it. Her actions don’t align. You don’t say someone made you feel safe, send them a loving goodbye voice note, tell them not to beat themselves up and then months later claim they assaulted you. You don’t show up in their classes, talk to their friends, and ruin their life if you’re genuinely scared of them.\n\nI come from a background where I’ve seen what assault can do. My younger sister was assaulted. I saw what that did to her. So for me to be put in the same category as someone like that? It kills me. I feel like I can’t breathe sometimes. I carry so much guilt for something I didn’t even do. Something she forgave me for, if it even needed forgiveness at all. And now I’m the bad guy. I’m the monster.\n\nAnd the worst part is I don’t want revenge. I don’t want to hurt her. I don’t want her to feel what I’m feeling. I don’t want people to see her as a liar or anything. I just want the truth. I want someone to listen. I want to be able to post the messages, the voice notes, the timeline and just have someone see what I see. Just once. I want someone to tell me I’m not crazy for being confused. That it doesn’t add up. That I’m not fucking insane for being hurt.\n\nPeople keep telling me “focus on yourself,” “move on,” “time heals,” but what am I supposed to do when I’m being labeled a predator and I can’t even defend myself? When my closest friends didn’t even ask for my side? When I’m scared to go to class? When I can’t join a sports team or a club because I don’t know who’s already heard the rumor?\n\nI keep a suicide note folded up in my pocket most days. Because sometimes I feel like I might just jump on a moving car, and I don’t want the driver to get into trouble and promise I won’t. But because I feel so hopeless that I need to be prepared in case one day it becomes too much. Sometimes I want to just post all the texts, the voice messages, the backstabbing friends blame them and end it all. But I don’t want anyone else to carry that guilt, so I won’t do anything. But god, the thought still lives in the back of my head like a fucking parasite. Every. Single. Day.\n\nWhat kind of person breaks up with someone, tells them they’re a good person, says they made them feel safe, then accuses them of assault, turns all their friends against them, and starts hanging out with them all while demanding no contact? How is that even real life? How do you forgive someone like that? How do you live with that? I genuinely cannot be making ts up.\n\nI want to share everything so so so badly. It’s so weird when you see our last conversations like two completely different people. I don’t want people to say I’m right, I just want them to see for themselves and make their own decisions but only after they have seen both sides. I’m not asking for pity. I just want someone to see that this is not what it seems. That I’m not the person she’s made me out to be. That my silence wasn’t guilt. It was fear. Fear that no one would care. I’d just get labeled a narcissist, a manipulator, or some incel who couldn’t move on. I genuinely don’t know how to go about this saying my truth while not disrespecting her.\n\nTL;DR: My ex falsely accused me of SA months after our breakup, despite her own voice note saying I made her feel safe and she still loved me. She turned all my friends against me, started hanging out with them, and left me isolated. I have the messages and proof, but I don’t know what to do. I feel hopeless, scared, and completely alone.",

    "selftext": "I'm a 20 year old college student and currently live with my dad and sister. Me and my dad don't have the best relationship as we constantly get into arguments. He fails to understand me and I keep letting him down because of his expectations of him wanting me to be someone he wants me to be. Not too go much into it, but I owe around $2k to him to pay back. I'm currently doing doordash to pay it off as of now and I have a moving company job lined up soon. However even with all this, he refuses to let me play the drums, which is the only source of happiness I have gotten in years, as well as restricting me from seeing any of my friends, in which I barely have as of now.\n\n  \nTo cope with this, I have been secretly smoking cigarettes while I work, which is something that he hates and has caught me multiple times doing so, as recent as today. He ended up throwing them out and stormed off. While I didn't know how to react with any emotion at this point, it lead me to think of harming myself with a kitchen knife. I've done this before in the past and have tried to stay off from doing it again for a few months, but this thought has come into my head stronger than before. I don't want to get mad or lash out on anyone around me, including my dad, so I resort to doing that. This is the accumulation of the many arguments we've had in the past month of August and a little before that. He's verbally abused me and has even hit me in the chest as recently as last week, when he caught me with cigarettes before. I genuinely can't take it anymore and it's wearing me down. With the new job and school semester coming up and even knowing I'm probably gonna get everything back in the next month or two, it's still too much and I'm not even looking forward to it anymore. It's gotten to the point where my self harm thoughts are slowly turning into suicidal thoughts, and my mind seems to ease into that thought without worry. I feel like I've let not only the people around me down, but also myself.\n\n  \nI don't know what to do anymore and I'm lost. Is there a better solution to all of this or steps that I can take to not have to have these thoughts and carry out on harming myself anymore?",

But I was willing to put all that aside because being unemployed is worse. \n\nThe thing is, my coworkers make it 10 times worse, they make me want to quit on a daily basis. They are the type of coworkers that thinks they're perfect and that they make no mistakes whatsoever, they want to take advantage of you and when they can't they become hostile and passive aggressive. \nOne in particular (we're three), is really hypocrite and thiks she's the perfect person. She tried to make me pay (literal money)for a mistake she did, I had to talk to our supervisor for her to back off. \n\nBut that only made it worse, I feel so tired and feel like I'm gonna have a panic attack everytime I think that I have to work with her, to make matters worse, she's the \"boos\" there in our farmacy, and that just makes my anxiety worse. I am a person that doesn't like conflict at all and try to avoid it at all costs all the time. \nI don't know what to do, I feel so stressed and tired, so fucking tired. Like it doesn't matter how much I sleep, I'm always tired. \n\nI want to quit so bad, but I don't want to be unemployed. In my country is really difficult to get a job, I had to search for around 7 years to find this one, while doing odd jobs to maintain myself. \n\nI've been dealing with depression and anxiety too for years, and yes, I'm in therapy, but honestly I don't feel like I'm getting better at all. Honestly this situation only makes me wanting to end it all even more. \n\nAnyway, I just needed to vent a little.  Thanks for reading.",

    "selftext": "What the title says. I've been living with suicidal ideation for what I'd consider a long time now, and I'm so tired of people trying to help by bringing up the same platitudes and baseless assertions over and over and over again. Telling me that I can do things that history shows I can't, and that I should believe in a better future when there is no reason to do so. In that vein, whatever you're thinking of saying to try to convince me that I shouldn't end it, I've likely heard it before, and it hasn't helped. My life is just a series of bad circumstances reinforcing each other in a way that make it impossible for me to break out of, and there's nothing I can expect from living longer other than more pain.\n\nYet I find myself trying to reach out over and over again. I know that no one and nothing can help, and anything anyone tries to do only results in frustration, but no one ever gives in either and acknowledges that ending myself does in fact make sense. They either just keep repeating the same dumb stuff over and over again, or just stop responding. And I guess I also keep reaching out because there still is a slight shimmer of hope in me that there is someone out there who can help after all. But the logical part of me knows that will never happen, it would be akin to a miracle at this point. But since I never find either the satisfaction or the relief, I'm stuck in a cycle of trying against my better judgment and getting frustrated in the end just like expected, and I'm sure it will be the same in this case.",

    "title": "It's been three years and I still think of her.",
    "selftext": "Three years and it feels like it all happened yesterday.\n\nI haven't moved on even after dating again and it's been years now.\n\nSo I 29M met my ex (let's call her Sam) back in 2021 when I was going through some rough time in my life. Suddenly everything started to go great in my life. I was in college studying what I always wanted, started making new friends (I've always struggled with that before and have had some insecurities about it) and landed a job. All of this around mid 2021. We used to spend so much time together. \n\nBy the end of the year I started to notice her more distant. There was this other guyfriend (amoung the many \"friends\" she had. Suddenly she was spending more time with others, and going out, etc. ( I was never jealous and I actually encourage having a life outside of the relationship). One day out of the blue she tells me this guy has had feelings for her for the past 13 years \"but it's alright because she's not interested\". Another time while I was working overnight she suddenly was hour and a half away driking with this other dude, but \"it's alright because there were others\". \n\nI should mention that through all the time I knew her she didn't present me to any of her friends. To give more context when I met her the first time in person she told me she was actually married but was going through a divorce. Back then I took it as a sign of honesty and trusted her. (That was the first red flag I ignored) \n\nSo fast foward to december when things were clearly not ok and we had an argument and ended up practicaly breaking up. To give more context here she started posting after the fight \"suicidal stuff\" and one pic looked like her arm cut. I got really worried and involved her family asking about her. Apparently I crossed a boundry there because she couldn't forgive me after that. \n\nAnyways we ended up going no contact for a month and still I checked on her socials. After a month I reached out because she was posting sad stuff, etc. But things were not the same anymore. She wanted to take things slowly. (We had been intimate many times before) and I kept trying to keep things going. Tried to talk to her, see her and overall just fix things, but she was different. Now she made excuses to not spend time with me while going out with her guy friend one on one. I was devastated and I realize I was too clingy too and that probably pushed her away further. But this woman suddenly seemed like she had no empathy for my feelings and also giving me a lot of mixed signals. \n\nAnyways now she was more invested un meeting others and living and partying a lot and just living her \"single\" life. Yet I clinged to her looking for a way to fix things and being happy with scraps of attention. \n\nI put her on this pedestal and I felt so inferior to her since this kept going and she told me on multiple ocassions that she and I were nothing and she owed me no explanations or nothing (she was right I know). She left me at the end of 2021. A month later I lost my job and had to drop out of college. My life was in shambles.\n\nI would like to make a pause and just say she was my first everything. She's the woman I first had intimacy with, the first person I loved and dated but given my inexperienced I committed one flaw that I'm sure played a rol in everything: I never \"officialy asked her to be my girlfriend because 1. I used to think that that's something that kids do in movies but in real life if we're spending time together and sleeping together and everything else then we're something more (wrong I know but I like to think in my ignorance it could have been talked and 2. SHE WAS STILL MARRIED. She kept me a secret from part of her family for that same reason because they knew her husband and didn't want him to find out. (That same family I had to involve earlier when she was going through a depressive episode and they asked me what we were and I told them)\n\nAnyways as this mind games of hers (trust me there was plenty more.) I got tired of being second choice. (Also I found out that HOURS after breaking up with me she was back on the same dating site I met her on) so I decided to do the same. I started trying to met new people and in doing so I met a new girl (who would later become my rebound relationship). This girl was sweet, kind and showed me affection and made me feel validated. So two weeks go by and finally I decided to tell my ex. I'm meeting someone else...\n\nWell...she was devastated (or at least appeared so) to the point she goes back into this deppresive episode talking about taking her life and not answering anyone. Suddenly I recieved a text message from a \"close relative\" of hers that told me exactly where she was because\"they had someone drive by and saw her\" and this supposed relative was telling me that Sam was a troubled child and that she had bipolar disorder and that she had been 5 times before in the hospital for attempted suicide (Sam told me many troubled and questionable stories about her past while we were together)\n\nAnyways I met her and we ended up talking for hours but in the end never managed to fix anything really. She was telling me to give myself a chance wiwth this new girl, etc. (Maybe she was testing me idk) but at the same time acted like we were suddenly something.) Truth be told I wanted to be with her of course. I loved her. (I'm sure people will say if I trully loved her then why did I met someone else and honestly I've fought myself with that for a long time). \n\nIn the end that was the last time I saw her in person. At the end I reached for a kiss but she pulled back. That pretty much felt like her not wanting me back and also honesty I was afraid of her lashing at me for betraying her. She was vengegul, so I was I afraid she would openly cheat on me as revenge. \n\nA month later I was officially dating someone else  (my rebound) I know this was wrong of me on so many levels. I undertand that now. This girl did not deserve all the pain I've put her through. Another month later my ex reached out again but this time she was not kind towards me and oretty much said her final goodbye. \n\nShe kept true to her word because I never heard anything directly from her ever again ( more than a year later some of her friend wrote me out of the blue, but I never replied)\n\nSo I was in a new relationship but it wasn't the same. The attraction wasn't there and I had many other issues with my new partner of jealousy, immaturity, etc. Funny enough the roles were reversed now in a way because this girl loved me intensely, but yet I could never return the affection. I never said I love you because I never felt it. I was with this new person but still longed for my ex, still checked her socials. And I saw my ex continue with her life. Sleeping around, partying, traveling, etc. \n\nEven after all of this I stayed in that new relationship for THREE YEARS. I had good moments but overall I could never shake my ex of my head. My new partner eventually found out and still stayed with me (surprisingly she's been supportive of me, even after all the pain I've made her suffer. She has hee issues like I and every other person too, but she's an angel)\n\nAnyways time passed but I never felt I got the closure I wanted and honestly I always fantasized about going back to my ex. Even after all the issues I felt more alive with her. I also struggled with life and financially too. Eventually it got better but still that longing for reconnecting was always there. I still checked on her socials (and mt ex one time found out and posting online mockingly that she was so fine that people still looked her up.)\n\nMeanwhile she was thriving. Living traveling and she even finished college!\n\nI was finally going to write to her but preparing myself for anything really. Well, I decided to unblock her and write but the I saw it. She's in a relationship (and not a secret one this time!) \n\nI saw her interacting with her boyfriend. They seem like they love eachother. Also it's a LDR it seems, but just seeing her with this other guy made me feel a rush of emotions. Happy in a way because she seems happy. Sad because that hope I had it's gone and in a way mad because in the end I was not reciprocated but now she's in a new relationship and all I got was a \"situationship\" and plenty of pain. Perhaps I deserve it. Not even sure if I should write again to express myself and get that closure I always wanted like I hoped. What's the point? It's over. It's been over for years but I was just too naive to see that. \n\nEven now, the \"what ifs\" are the worse. I keep telling myself, \"what if I had stayed single and reached out to her? Would things be different?\" I love her, but I feel my chance to see and to try to fix things is gone forever now. \n\nSo yeah that's my \"short\" story about my mess of a life. I've been to therapy for almost a year now and also I'm actively trying to go back to college again.",

Im not sociopathic as I still feel emotions but only really in extremes and for very brief moments, 90% of the time its just neutral, and I cant tell if I just am out of touch with my feelings but its crushing to me. Im constantly lethargic and just cant bring myself to do anything, I have very little motivation to do anything and i act almost entirely on impulse when it comes to doing things.\n\nDue to my empty feeling I find it really hard to make and maintain friendships and when I do make them it always feels one sided and as if im forcing the friend ship. Im almost always the person to initiate conversation and I frequently see people hang out without messaging me or inviting me. I get nervous talking to people in person and I struggle to go out and socialize in public places. Recently ive been going to class again in a trade school which has helped a bit but I still feel as if im an outsider and almost invisible even thought people do talk to me sometimes. Because of the fact I feel as if im forcing friend ships my mind is filled with a lot of self doubt and I often time making fiction scenarios where I fit in more. Overall i just feel really disconnected from people and I just cant read people very well.\n\nDespite my love for aviation and everything related to it the class still leaves me unfulfilled as well. I took flight school for a bit before swapping to becoming a mechanic and I absolutely loved flying and learn about aircraft but no matter what I did I just felt like I wanted to do something more. Despite trying a lot of different things and learning about a bunch of different career paths none seem like they would satisfy this itch I have.\n\nDue to the issues mentioned above I constantly fall in and out of something like a depressive state of sorts completely ruining my self confidence and making me even more lethargic than I normally am. Ive never been officially diagnosed so I dont know if its genuine or not but it makes me feel horrible mentally. I cant bring myself to talk to anyone about it because of trust issues I have and me just not feeling comfortable sharing my feels and also not being to articulate how I feel very well. Suicidal thoughts, while less common than they used to be, still occur but I havent had any urge to act on them for a long time.\n\nI just hate feeling like im useless and unwanted, and due to my social situation and the emptiness I feel constantly I just feel like trash constantly. Im the only one in my family who has had mental issues like this and no one really understands how I feel in my family. I love my family and they really do care but they just tend to brush away or under estimate how bad I feel simply because they dont understand how I feel. I just feel stuck and as if im rapidly approaching a dead end and if I hit another one I really just dont know where I would go after.",

    "selftext": "I'm turning 26 soon and every passing day feels like a death sentence. I hate my birthday. I always have. It's like a painful fucked up reminder that nobody actually gives a shit about me and that I have to suffer through yet another year when all I've wanted for as long as I can remember is to be done with it all. I thought about trying to set something up this year, even just a dinner with friends, but I kept putting it off because I'm terrified no one will show up and it'll just prove what I already know - that if I disappeared today it would take forever for anyone to even notice let alone care.\n\nI was 8 years old the first time I saw a therapist. It didn't last long, I barely remember it, but I started up again at 17 after begging my parents to put me back in for a couple years. They told me it would be a waste of money because I wouldn't talk to the therapist anyways. They finally took it seriously when they found out I was cutting myself, which I had started when I was about 12 and hid for all those years. Since then I've seen countless therapists and psychiatrists and have been hospitalized and done so many programs and nothing has really helped. I've been in abusive relationships. My parents are alcoholics and addicts themselves and have abused me as well. Not to the same extent as others so I always feel weird talking about it, but I've still been through it.\n\nI started drinking when I was 13. Not all the time, I didn't really get drunk until I was probably 16, but then it got a bit more frequent. It's only more recently that I've been getting shitfaced 1-3 times a week. I started smoking weed at 18, then proceeded to smoke weed 24/7 for about 3 years until I finally stopped because I realized it was making my anxiety and paranoia skyrocket. Since then I'd tried a handful of drugs for fun here and there. A couple months ago I started getting into harder drugs and now do them 1-2 times a week, usually when I'm drinking.\n\nI also started hooking up with random people and sometimes friends in the midst of all this. It's made so many relationships complicated and I can finally see that I'm treating not only myself but also others poorly. All because I'm still running from my past and myself. I hate myself so deeply and I'm so sad that my life has gone this way.\n\nEarly this year I finally started working on myself after a breakup and a big surgery. I was on a really good path for a few months there and was actually learning to love myself and live my life in a way that was fulfilling. It all came crashing down the past couple months though when I started drinking more frequently and doing drugs and hooking up with strangers. I don't know why I keep doing it. Every week I tell myself I'll stop and then the weekend rolls around and I repeat it all over again and every time I hate myself even more. It feels good in the moment, sort of, but then I'm just full of regret and anxiety and physically feel like shit.\n\nI'm tired of myself and of my life and I wish I could just start over. I've been keeping this all in for so long and have grown distant from my friends in pursuit of people who I can party with and even that's gotten messy and is falling apart. I wish I never started any of this. I wish I could stop. I wish I had self control. I wish I was a different person so I didn't have to live with this constant cycle of self hatred and fear. I don't know what to do, all I know is that I'm spending my birthday alone again this year because I'm scared to face what I feel. That everyone I know secretly hates me as much as I hate myself.",

    "title": "Crashed my car and I want to die again",
    "selftext": "This morning I was on my way to grab some food to bring to an event in my college when I (not noticing the empty & low to the ground carry-on and thinking the truck was normal and fully past me) rammed my small car into a long steel(?) truck carry thing. Basically like a long flat board of heavy material with nothing on it. Not sure about the specific names, sorry. Anyways, I didn’t do any damage to his carry on but my car is pretty fucked. Like the whole right side is messed up. And the car wasn’t worth much in the first place, it’s a 2013 Hyundai. Anyways, I’m 18 and unemployed and I can’t get a new car or pay for repairs over 500. That’s all I have saved. My insurance won’t cover it, and might go up because of it. I can’t afford that.\n\nOther than that, I’ve struggled basically all my life. My mom was an abusive (more emotionally than physically) alcoholic, my dad was angry and would accuse me of being like her everytime I would get upset since I was like 8. My mom also had abusive boyfriends all my life. Because of this, I guess, or for whatever reason, im all messed up. Diagnosed severe depression and anxiety. The first time I remember vocalizing suicidal thoughts I was nine years old. I stopped eating for half a year when I was 11 and had to be force fed enough to keep me alive. I was skin and bone. I’m also autistic and I’ve got something wrong with me where I’m always fatigued no matter how much I eat or drink or exercise or whatever. I can’t do shit for very long. Finally, I’ve got a girlfriend who’s become the center of my world (I’m a girl, we’re gay lol) but she goes to another college (she’s much smarter than me, I couldn’t get it) and her ma is (though she pretends not to be) homophobic and doesn’t let us see eachother often. Even though she’s 18, she still gets her mom’s approval.\n\nSo here’s why the car has fucked me up completely: the only way I’m able to go see her is to drive to her dorm and hang for the weekend. I can’t see her otherwise. I don’t know what to do. It’s not like some normal I’m in love stuff, I am in love, but more than that she’s also literally the only reason I’m still alive. She saved my life about a half a year ago when I was insanely suicidal. I was genuinely going to kill myself but she stopped me. She’s really all I have, I’m horrible at connecting with people otherwise. I care about her so much and she makes me so happy. I might have some kinda BPD attatchment or something because I literally can’t stand when she’s not with me. I’m not jealous really or things like that I just don’t want to be around if she isn’t with me. My mom has bipolar or BPD I forget which to be honest. Anyways, without the car we won’t really see eachother. I was doing better on the suicidal thoughts when we were together still going to highschool but right now it’s back. My dad is super man at me too and I don’t have anyone right now. I went back to my mom’s house but she doesn’t really care, we just sit in different rooms and stuff. We don’t really talk because of all the stuff when I was a kid. My girlfriend went back to her mom’s too which is only 20 minutes away, but because her mom doesn’t want her to she can’t come over. She cares, but she has limits like most people do. She wouldn’t break her mom’s rule to come see me, even when she knows I’m feeling like this.That’s just not how she is. It’s not her responsibility anyway, but I’m just alone right now and I had to do all the car stuff today alone too.\n\nAlso, my childhood dog is dying, so that’s a big thing. That was stressing me out when I was driving earlier. I shouldn’t have driven. But I don’t know how to handle that either\n\nAnyways, sorry for being all over the place. I hope this is okay, I’ve never posted here before. I just wanted to get this out",

    "selftext": "TW for mental health issues.\n\nI’ve been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since my teen years. I’m 31 now. I’m not suicidal though - I just want to get BETTER.\n\nI’ve been seeing doctors since I was about 17. I’ve tried therapists and so, so many medications. SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, benzos, sleeping aids, even went to see a naturopath for supplements. Nothing has worked. I’ve given these meds a chance, often on them for months or years, but either they had side effects I just couldn’t deal with, didn’t touch my mental health disorders at all, or made them even worse. I had an attempt at 23 years old. I’ve been in therapy but I have a hard time applying what I’ve learned in therapy to my daily life. My jobs have suffered, my relationships have suffered. Every day feels like a struggle that I have to push through. I can’t remember the last time I felt joy, or even calm. Now, the anxiety is creeping into my physical health - I can’t sleep or eat, I’m constantly in pain, and my hair is falling out. \n\nTwo years ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had to go through chemo and everything. I’m in remission, but my oncologist says I now have PTSD from treatment. Great. Even though I’m physically healthy, the emotional/mental impact of treatment still lingers. I’ve lost 30 lbs in two months from barely eating. I now weight 100 lbs. \n\n\ntoday I saw my psychiatrist to tell her these meds aren’t working. I’ve been on this one antidepressant since January, hoping for a miracle. But I have 0 hunger cues and can’t get out of bed. It’s making me worse. She now says I have treatment resistant depression. We can try a new med of course, but then she said something else-\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy.\n\nShe told me it’s not like back in the days. It’s not like the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. She said I will have problems with memory loss after. But that it will reset my brain. And that many people have found relief with this treatment. It’s modern, and many people don’t understand the way it works now.\n\nShe gave me some time to think it over. I would have to go to a psychiatric hospital to have the procedure. A good hospital. The hospital treats those with acute mental health disorders and they have the equipment to handle the procedure.\n\nShe made the referral to the hospital as there is a waiting time. She said it is my decision. I am so desperate to find something that works, but I’m so unsure about this.\n\nMy grandmother got ECT in the 80s. She forgot a lot of things and my mom said it made her “worse.” But my psych assured me it’s not the 80s anymore.\n\nI don’t know what to do. Like I said, I’m desperate for help. It’s why I’ve tried so many meds and therapists for over a decade and nothing is helping. I even got fired by a therapist once because he told me I had too much going on that he wasn’t qualified for. I respect that but my self esteem went down the drain.\n\nI’m doing research on this now but I have no idea what to do. On one hand, I would do anything to find relief from this. On the other hand, I’m a teacher, I have two degrees, my memory and intellect is important to me and losing that will make me go insane.\n\nNo one in my life understands what I’m going through. I just need to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading.",

    "selftext": "*TLDR;* had a whirlwind perfect romance two years ago. Visited ex and found someone who became deeply self-absorbed, who’s crashing out, and who treats me like shit. \n\n*Long version:* Two years ago, I fell in love for the first time while studying abroad. I met a dude at a college bar, talked with him for five minutes, and felt like we were going to fall in love and break up in a year when I moved back home. I felt like he’d break me, but he’d be worth it.\n\nThat’s exactly what happened. We had a slow burn friends-to-lovers arc that escalated into us getting together and moving in with each other on the same day. We built a loving, healthy, passionate relationship and it was the most happy time of my life… until he got his dream PhD offer to stay at our uni, and I moved back home (my field pays 2-3x more in my home country and I’d have had to go into massive debt for a temporary visa.)\n\nWe broke up at the airport, and I moved home with $20 in the bank, no job, and fell into a deep depression. It took me a YEAR for my life to start moving again, but I ultimately landed my dream job and rebuilt myself. I’ve made lifelong friends, I’ve happily dated… but haven’t fallen in love. On a bad day I wondered if I did the right thing leaving him. \n\nI planned a trip back to visit friends abroad… then my ex found out, called me, and had a 4 hour meltdown about how he’s single, his breakup has been toxic, and he’s failing out of his PhD. I asked him why he was telling me all this and if he was trying to friendzone me or solicit a fling. He got offended and said he just wanted emotional support. I asked him not to speak to me about his breakup but (stupidly) still tried to help.   \n\nThen I arrived abroad, and a close friend told me “I adore him, but he’s been insufferable lately.” Another friend blurted out “I just think you should know you haven’t missed out by breaking up with him; he’s been pretty self-absorbed for the past two years.” Everyone told me he had become so fixated on his life and problems he’d lost perspective and kindness. I was totally floored. I really wanted to assume he was just having a rough patch, not a yearlong downward spiral. \n\nBut then I met ex in person and he spent the whole time crashing out AGAIN about his breakup and PhD… and I realized the first guy I ever loved couldn’t even see me when I was standing right in front of him after coming from a continent away. Even when I asked him not to repeatedly, he always found a way to sprinkle in hurtful details (told me he’s slept with 8 women since me but never been in love again, told me his ex’s name, height, personality, insecurities, that girls often get hung up on him, that I was so out of line for asking about a fling it was laughable, that he didn’t want to die alone but he’d never do a marriage pact with me, etc.) And it just clicked. \n\nI kept growing up and he didn’t. The first dude I ever loved doesn’t think about me or my feelings at all. Standing in the place I fell in love with him with nothing left, I realized I don’t like him at all anymore and I deserve better. \n\nThank God I didn’t stay two years ago. Thank God I lost him. And thank God this gave me closure and self-assurance I am actually already living my best life. \n\nOnward and upward. Hope this helps anyone stuck romanticising an ex who doesn’t deserve it. ",

    "selftext": "So when I was younger, like in my 20s, I developed a very small and very manageable case of social anxiety.   I would be super anxious if I was around more than a few people but after being around them for a few minutes I felt fine.\n\nFor some reason, soon after this, I started thinking about people who have involuntary head movements , like people with Tourettes, like involuntary type shit.  I kind of became super scared about it for some weird reason.  \n\nSo moving on to my mid 20s,  I had a delivery job where sometimes I would have to walk through a crowded Restaurant to make the delivery and lots of times it was me walking through like 2 or 3 times.  I was very, very deep into my social anxiety now.  I started noticing people nodding at me as if I had just nodded at them.  And I’m talking like people doing this a shit ton. I would be taking a left turn into some business and a truck driving past me would nod and I’m like WTF?  Why!\n\nLong story short, I’m pretty sure my weird ass, ridiculous ass fear, somehow changed me as a person.  Everybody nods at me and I’m sure I never nodded at them.  Listen I’ve never told anybody this.   But it’s the root of why I can’t go out to even family get togethers without a drink first. \n\nI take benzos which help\nMe a lot at work, around people I’ve known for a few years, but when there’s someone around in don’t know or even just passing them in the hallway, I get nervous and I KNOW my head is doing some weird shit and nodding at them.   I’m so fucking embarrassed to even say this.  I’ve literally never told another human being.    But I know it happens.  Someone who I don’t know too well came to work with us today and I was just adjusting my earbud and like after a hours working with him he nodded and then looked to my buddy, a worker im with constantly and smiled at him\nLike almost expecting a laugh, but\nMy normal coworker wasn’t looking at him.  Like of course I would never try to give a head nod to someone after like two hours of working togther.  I know I dis it involuntarily.  And the same shit happens at stores.  I can’t even go grocery shopping  unless I’ve had a little to drink.   It sucks.  People *mostly* only nod at you when you nod first.  \n\nWhy has this happened to me?   I’m legit at the point that I want to end it all.  I can’t go anywhere unless I take a mega dose of my anxiety meds and if not that I have to drink a little hard alcohol to get regular shit done.\n\nI’m 40 and this has ruined\nMy life since around 24 or 26.\n\nI can’t even believe I just wrote this out it’s so fucking embarrassing.  I’m sorry for the long post.   But im at my wits end.  I legit can never go on vacation or be with a big group of people without drinking.   I have extreme social anxiety because I have this involuntary head movement that apparently I made up in my head.  \n\nI’ve never even told any of the therapists or psychiatrists because I know I’ll sound so dumb.  Am I crazy?  Who turns a fear into a real thing?   How th hell did this happen?  I’m like one more bad day from ending it I promise you.  \n\nNo one will probably read this because it’s so long.   Which sucks because i would really appreciate some suggestions of how I got\nThis way,   The thing is if I didn’t have involuntary head movement I wouldn’t really gaf about going in groups but this head movement thing is the ONLY thing keeping me from experiencing more\nFrom life or even getting a better paying job \n\nEdit: when I say I’m sure I never nodded at them , I mean I never voluntarily nodded.  But my head has other ideas i guess.  I feel like I’m the only people in the world that has ever had this problem.  I actually might be.  I’m jealous of everyone else who never has to worry about the shit their head does.  Jesus this is embarrassing ",

It's in every way my fault because I told him just how to kill himself. I'll live with this guilt for the rest of my life, and I deserve to because it's my fault. I gave him that advice because I know what it's like to be suicidal, I was like \"It's selfish if I force him to stay and not give him what he wants\" and at the time, I thought I was actually being helpful. But no, either way, I was being selfish. I fucking hate myself and I fuck everything up everyday. I deserve to be guilty.

He hasn't responded yet, which makes me worried. I'll edit this post again when he responds, which hopefully will be soon. Thanks for your guys' advice on talking to him more\n\nEDIT 2: Alright, so thank God he responded.

We started talking, she vented to me a lot about how she's bullied, her mother passed away and her father's absent. She said she was 13 years old, and I really wanted her to like me, so I said the same. I gave her advice and comfort, and it wasn't long until I started feeling like the therapist friend. Even though it was an online friendship, I still felt responsible for her well-being, since I had to talk her out of self harm and running away many times. I felt forced whenever she called me or texted me, but I was really scared to end my friendship with her. I never had an online friend before, and didn't know how to handle this. Eventually I got tired of the only topic being venting, and also got tired of being a free therapist, so I blocked her on every site I had her added. It was all well for a month, when her friends started messaging me, asking me to text her again because she misses me and is really hurt by me etc. And that's when I did something I'm terribly ashamed of. Her friend accused me of hurting her, and I was afraid of hurting people my entire life. I was selfish, and didn't want her to remember me as someone who tossed her aside in her time of need, so I had my cousin text her friend saying that I passed away. I'm so incredibly ashamed of this, and it's not something I can undo. I feel like if I came clean, it would do more harm than good. I just can't believe she's left mourning someone who's not even dead. I can't believe I thought blocking her would hurt her more than losing a friend. A part of me wants to believe I was just young, used, scared and inexperienced in something like this, but the lot bigger part of me is saying that I lied to an innocent girl who needed a friend in her time of need, I hurt her and I'm not sure if I can ever forgive myself or if it'll haunt me forever like it haunted me for years now. My friends say I should forgive myself, but they are my friends, are they supposed to call me a bitch and walk away? I feel vulnerable and pathetic asking strangers' opinion, but if it helps me finally sleep at night without guilt, I'll do it. So please, don't hold back when you're replying, and I'm begging anyone to reply even if to bash me.",

    "selftext": "(ANOTHER WARNING: POST WILL INCLUDE TALKS ABOUT SA, SU*CIDE, P0RN0GRAPHY AND MENTAL HEALTH)\n\nYes, I S*xually ass*ulted my little sister, I beg u to please read what I'm about to say.\n\nI wanna start by saying that I'm currently between the age of 15-18 (don't wanna disclose that info) and I'm also a male.I was 9-10 years of age at the time when what I'm gonna tell u happened. \n\nI used to be a more quiet but very innocent kid. I had great friends and have a very loving family. I grew up with a older brother and sister, and always wanted a little sibling. I have a soft spot for children and the thought of having someone look up to me in a good way was fun. When I was 7 my parents told me that my mom was pregnant. Hearing that news I probably was the happiest I've ever been, I was very excited. Then came the day she was born, seeing and holding her in my hands was incredible and I felt like a proud big brother. I always was and still am as gentle as possible around my sister and could not imagine hurting her in any way, I mean I love her to death and would give my life for her. \n\nI think where it started going wrong was when I got my first actual phone, which I freely could use. I think u probably already know about the fact that p0rn is very popular among curious young children, sadly this is a fact. At my school there were kids talking seeing pictures of naked woman and stuff like that, and with me now having access to the internet and being curious I told my friend while playing outside that I was gonna look this up. We looked up pictured of naked women on Google  and reacted like any 9-10 year old would. After more and more time I got more and more curious and started looking it up at home now aswell. It's obviously not what a 9-10 year old should do but this is sadly the reality we are living in. \n\n(THIS IS WHERE IT GETS MORE GRUESOME, 1 LAST WARNING)\nPLEASEEE READ THIS PART!!! I wanna instantly state that at the time I didn't grasp the severity of the situation, I also wanna make it very clear I didn't r*pe my sister nor did I do anything to stain her for life, she doesn't even know it was SA, and honestly neither did I. It also doesn't involve me or her directly touching each other inappropriately. My sister was 3 at the time and I was around 10.\n\nWe were I think home alone, and just playing around when me and my sister went up to my room, still very harmless. We went in my room and both went to lay in my bed just playing games on the phone when I got a notification, 9-10 year old me was dumb enough to enable notifications of some weird s*xting website I stumbled upon, and didn't know how to turn those of. I looked at it and saw a naked women m*asturbating. I close it and just go back to playing games with my sister, but that videoclip stayed in my mind. We were under the blanked and I just suddenly get the urge to go up and down with my knee around my sister her upper leg, and came fairly close to the genital area, never touched it with my knee but came pretty close. This lasted around 2 seconds and then my sister says to me in a laughing playful voice 'that tickles' and she starts tickling me. I tickle her back and we just go back to playing together not realizing that I just SA'D my sister. In my mind I had the clip of the woman masterbating while I did this aswell, not at all imagining my sister or anything close to that but still that clip of that woman in my mind.\n\nI might be overexagerating and that this isn't as severe as I'm making it out to be, but u gotta realize I love my sister a lot, more then anyone on this planet. \n\n(I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR IM NOT SEEKING EMPHATY AT ALL, I JUST WANT THIS OF MY CHEST CUZ ITS GENUINELY KILLING ME)\n\nNow a few years go by and I never think of it not once, and I'm sure my sister doesn't even realize what happened.When I got old enough to realize right from wrong I at a random night suddenly thought of this moment again, since then I just burst into tears every time I think of it. I cant live with the thought that I actually did this, this isn't me at all and not something I would ever think of doing or even do, yet I did it. I honestly have been having suicidal thought because of this.\n\nThis might have been a rushed post but I hope u can after reading this get a grasp of the situation, I genuinely appreciate everyone that read this and wish u all the best in life.",

    "selftext": "In September 2023, I began attending university in Canada. Before I left Nigeria, my father instructed me to set up a second savings account that would serve as a sort of emergency fund. He gave me about CA$6,000.00 to deposit there after I had set it up.  did exactly as I was told. However, over the next year I slowly used up that money by doing things like ordering takeout, making impulsive purchases, and paying for unnecessary subscriptions despite the fact that he made regular wire transfers to my checking account for my upkeep. Subsequently, whenever he would make a wire transfer to the savings account, I would spend it all in the blink of an eye. I also kept track of how much money I'd spent so that when he asked for the account balance, I could reply with that amount. The following winter, the account after its balance had sat at CA$0.00 for too long. Of course, I hid that information from him as well.\n\nThat wasn't the only way I was wasting my father's hard-earned money while lying to him about it. After the fall semester of my first year, my academic performance began to significantly decline and at one point, I stopped attending classes all together. Whenever my father would ask about my grades, I would simply respond with random numbers between seventy-five and ninety. I was placed on academic suspension three months ago, but I am in the process of challenging that decision. My poor academic performance can indeed be attributed to avolition caused by mental health conditions, but I still deserve to be held responsible for being dishonest with my father.\n\nI am making this post because my father currently here me in Canada. This evening, he told me he would like to visit the bank in the morning to make a deposit into that savings account. Of course, that means he is likely to discover the truth I have been hiding for two years. I intend to confess to him first by this morning, in a few hours, but I am extremely scared. I am worried that he may send me back to Nigeria, that he may disown me, or become violent towards me — verbally or physically. I know I deserve all these things, but I do not want to face them. Any advice or comfort would be appreciated!\n",

    "selftext": "For the past couple years of my life I’ve felt incredibly lonely. This started when Covid happened and everyone was locked up in their homes and I had no one. No friends to call. No people to play games with. I was all alone. I felt so alone and depressed. Going back into school I felt super anxious and it was hard to talk to people I didn’t think I deserved help because my situation wasn’t dire enough to need help. I gave up on trying to make friends. I kept the ones I had but just barely. \nThis only led me to harming myself. I would scratch myself until I bled and would punch myself until I’d bruise. I’d never cut, I was too scared to cut. My situation was getting worse but I refused to get help because I thought if I wasn’t strong enough to get through it on my own I didn’t deserve to live. This thought process evolved into suicidal behavior and I ended up attempting twice in my last year of middle school. \nGoing into high school I decided to try and make a fresh new start. I made some friends and I was starting to enjoy life. The sh addiction persisted but slowly I became better and better. I was keeping myself busy with extracurricular activities and hanging out with friends. Fast forward I’m going into my senior year and I’m a year clean in 2 days. \nJust thinking about how selfish and stupid my decisions are makes me hate myself. I’ve been thinking about relapsing a lot lately because I’m so mad at what I’ve done to myself. (Last post ended up not happening I talked myself out of it) It’s like this vicious cycle of self harm and then hating myself for doing it and then back to harming myself as a form of punishment. \n\nIn short I hurt myself because I think I don’t deserve happiness. And I don’t think I deserve happiness because I’ve hurt myself in the past to the point where I was going to end it all. ",

    "selftext": "Im going to start out by saying I know I should always take my medication and I shouldn't have skipped. \n\nOn Saturday I read what I thought were the correct instructions for a colonoscopy/endoscopy  prep that was happening on Tuesday. What i read was that I needed to go on a clear liquid diet and drink a bottle of Miralax on sunday then the next day take a different laxative and more miralax. I later realized (after drinking all the miralax) that I read the wrong email and I needed to Ingest even more miralax and other laxatives. That being said, first I dont do well with stomach pain, or throwing up or any of that gross stuff. Second I am  not supposed to take my meds with out food as it hurts my stomach. I went 2 days without eating, and 2 days without medication of any kind.  I only drank what I had to. The first  day I felt this anxious feeling in my chest that I recognized but shrugged off because I knew my tummy hurt… the anxiety feeling grew and got worse as the day wore on… I started being flooded with this emotional pain I recognized but couldn't escape. My stomach hurt worse and worse. My head was foggy, I was dizzy, shakey and everything felt overstimulating. I couldn't think a clear thought, but I kept coming back to I am feeling the pain of the girl I left on the bridge.(I tried to kms a few years ago) The girl that walked from chaos and abuse to the next shitty chaos and abuse. All she did was abuse her anxiety medication and stuff her pain away and Harbour resentment. She abused her anxiety medication and turned into a worse monster, lashing out and neglecting  her kids and husband. She lied about her sober date for years because she thought this stuff is helping me. Im a better person on the pills.  She hated herself for all things she had done to keep the hurt and anxiety away. The Sex and drugs and lies piled up around her until she blew up so badly that she left. She fucked up that relationship too. That girl, me, didnt, doesn't know to cope with the pain of the past. I felt the anger, the pain, the hurt from that girl I left behind. I felt the guilt and shame I lied about and hid away. I feel that anger slip through sometimes and I lash out, I yell and scream and fight it. I dont  know how to control it, it just comes out of me before I have a chance to think. I get those cravings to take my anxiety meds to sleep or bury the hurt away. \nWhen I was finally ready for my procedure after 2 days of misery, I acted like an ass to hide my fear but when they wheeled me into the procedure room I lost it. All that anxiety,fear,pain, hurt, guilt and shame toppled over on top of me and I couldnt breathe or see. I felt all of it. The voice in my head screaming to end it all, find a way to make it stop. They put me out and I woke up and went home pretty sour feeling. I held it all in while that anxiety built and built again. I tried to distract and use my skills. I was eating and drinking again and I took my meds but I opened something I couldn't take back or hide away anymore. I broke down on tuesday afternoon and cried to my husband I told him all my sins, all the lies, all the hurt. He didnt judge me but I felt… raw and ugly. The voice Inside my head quieted some after I let it out but there is this pit, this rock, something heavy that sits inside my chest and stomach. I feel the darkness it puts off. I feel the pain. I feel the weight of what that girl I hid away went through. All her sins uncovered. I dont know how I managed to stay alive in that era. I find myself a little sad that I did stay alive. I dont know how long I can hold onto this pain before I give in… \n",

I struggle with suicidal ideation too much. I am diagnosed with PDD (persistent depressice disorder) and a few other things that I suspect, but I feel weird even considering. Since the great \"self diagnosing fakers\" that would do weird shit on social media for attention, I feel like I can't even wonder if I have something without it being perceived that way. There was also the time I asked only if I could be tested for ADHD and my doctor at the times response was \"Hmm I think you just need more sleep.\" Later I was diagnosed with ADHD.lol.\n\nI've made so many fuck-ups in my life. I am always inflicting on some sort of self destructive or harming behavior and I don't know how to stop. I struggle with addiction and nobody knows.\n\nI hide so well, mask so well, because honestly when I am around others, for the most part I am fine (unless I'm having a particularly bad day). \n\nI only ever have a desire to hurt myself, NEVER others. I genuinely try to be kind to others and give what I can, when and where I can. Sometimes my kindness is misplaced but I try. \n\nI know I need therapy and believe me I have made so many genuine attempts. The healthcare system is a joke. Having therapists constantly leave the practice, I followed one from practice to practice until he tells me he's no longer going to be providing a therapy service - like come on. This was the second time. Do you know how frustrating it is to have to open up to someone, only for them to leave after not even a whole year and you find someone new, they quit after a few months... I'm so tired. Of having to repeat myself. Open up to someone new only for them to quit. I need help desperately and I try, of course I have to keep trying, but why can't a therapist just stick around for once. \n\nMy childhood was so fucked up but it wasn't, at the same time. I feel like I don't deserve to complain sometimes because I am blessed in many ways. Despite being mentally ill I know I lucked out in the \"looks\" department which has given me many advantages in life, but it's not forever.\n\nHowever I physically can't end my life because my pet turtle depends on me, and I love her so much. I have to stay alive and healthy so I can take care for her and give her the best life I can give. Someday I'm going to build her a custom indoor pond, just for her.\n\nI just want to go back to before I became so fucked up, I wish my parents did something and paid more attention, I wish I could go back in time and fix every because I know the exact moment where my internal self was destroyed and it's horrible knowing everything could have been prevented.\n\nI hadn't thought about cutting myself in 10 years but lately the thoughts have been returning out of nowhere and I'm reminding myself that I cannot, because it would be too obvious, I love to dress up and it's still summer and there's now at for me to hide or cover shit up. So I resort to abusing marijuana. \n\nLastly, I know I have loved ones around me. My workplaces are aware I have depression but I hide it well, aside from the few times I've been in tears (unrelated to work, I actually love my jobs and part of why I picked up a 2nd was to keep my mind busy). But aren't they just TIRED? I mean, everyone's depressed right? Everyone's got their own problems and shit. I feel like everyone's over it even though I mostly keep it  to myself and only occasionally open up about this",

    "selftext": "I was always timid and shy. Never stood out; never tried to. I struggled with self-esteem. Self-confidence. Self-worth. In second grade, my elementary school teacher asked my mother if everything was alright at home because I was so meek and uncertain of myself. I most certainly didn’t realize it then, but I had no sense of self-preservation, in that I didn’t feel like I mattered. I didn’t feel capable. I didn’t feel worthwhile.\n\nI self-harmed for the first time when I was thirteen. Eighth grade was the first time in my life that I can remember feeling actively suicidal. There’s no need to get into the nitty gritty of why. Simply put, no one should ever feel as if they want to die. It’s a terrible, lonely place to be. But, the point of this is not to be a biography. \n\nI’m a few years shy of thirty now. I don’t have years and years of life experience under my belt, but I’ve struggled and I’ve suffered and I’ve flourished and I’ve lived. I’ve given up and toiled and experimented and given up again and toiled some more. I’ve tried and tried and stopped trying and tried again. I’ve let the lows crash over me and drown me, and I’ve ridden the highs like there was no tomorrow — throwing caution to the wind and taking risks to feel alive while I could. I lived a life perpetually tumbling in the throes of dysregulation. \n\nAnd right now? For the first time in my life, I’m showing up for myself. I’m looking in the mirror and I’m seeing someone whose curves and smile and wavy hair I never stopped to admire before. I’m looking beyond her bright green eyes and I’m seeing her laughter and her tears and her passion and her love and her spark. \n\nAnd, yeah, I know it’s not going to last. Turmoil and struggle are inevitable. But so too is tranquility. Contentedness. Joy. Peace. Laughter. I find purpose and comfort and determination in knowing that even though things are going to eventually start to crumble again, I can build them back up stronger than before — because I’ve gained the tools and resources to do so.\n\nNow, I’ll be honest: it’s not easy to build that toolbox. But I’ll be damned if I don’t tell you it’s worth it to do so. Therapy. Medication. Friends. Family. Partners. Pets. Hobbies. Sunrises. Sunsets. Et cetera. Et cetera. Et cetera. These are reasons and tools and resources. Utilize them. I cannot stress enough that, whoever you are: you are worthy. It is okay to ask for help. \n\nYou’re here on this big rock, and I can’t say that I know why. But I do know that I was tired of feeling like I didn’t belong here. I was tired of feeling like I needed justification to simply be alive. And goddamn, I never want anyone to ever feel that way. Because you know what? Fuck ‘why’. You’re here. Who cares why? You’re here.  \n\nSometimes I really wish I could go back and mend the fragile heart of the little girl I once was. I wish I could hold her and tell her how beautiful the world is and how unique it is because she, too, is a part of it. I wish I could remind her that love comes in many forms and life is a breathing, humming cycle. Then I remind myself that living and loving and being in the here and now are the best ways to heal and honor that little girl. They are the best ways to honor me.\n\nYou will feel as if the universe is trying to smother you. You will feel as if the universe is in the palm of your hand. Good days. Bad days. Weeks. Months. Years. You will ache from the deepest chasms that is your spirit, but that means you will love from the unfathomable depths that is your heart. You have cried with joy. You have smiled in anguish. To know agony is to know revelry. There is beauty in suffering… without it, we could not begin to comprehend the magnificence that is joy.\n\nThe universe has not forsaken you. You are the most menacing of storms and the most tranquil of mornings. \n\nI think… what I’m trying to say is… who cares if the cup is half empty or half full? \n\nJust take a sip.",

It was the worst that men had to offer on full display all day every day. I can't go into much detail about what all went on because it's graphic. But there were age of consent debates constantly. A lot of men on there wanted young girls to reproduce. Marital rape is okay. If a woman is assaulted she did something to deserve it. Just horrible.\n\nI tried to strongarm myself into liking women because of a combination of iFunny and because my father was abusive. I kissed a girl and I really hated it and didn't know what to do. I know this is a weird thing to confess. That an app could give you so many psychological issues. But it did. ",

    "title": "Thinking about death",
    "selftext": "I’m not suicidal or anything, but lately I have a big reaction and sometimes start crying out of nowhere when thinking about death. Has this happened to you? Is this normal to happen at about post puberty? Thoughts? Religious and non religious are welcome to share but please no discussion of convincing people to one or the other or arguing about what happens after death (though you’re free to share what you think)\n\n(I’m a heavy atheist but I promise anyone can comment)\n\nPutting some of my thoughts down: I am a firm believer that all of our thoughts and actions are lead by our brains, and that is the root of my afterlife beliefs. Therefore I believe that when we die, we stop thinking and cease to be the same person, and that sucks. I would love to live in a world where we know what happens, I’m sure a lot of people would. I don’t care whether it’s heaven or hell, the only two possibilities for me are something, or nothing. I really hope it’s not nothing. Maybe I’ll come to terms with it later in my life, but right now I wish I was religious. Almost every religion believes that there’s something, after all. My glimmer of hope is the world behind my eyes. My body is just a glob of mass, and I get that the electrical pulses in that mass govern my emotions, my thoughts, and my senses, but regardless, what am I? Rocks are just globs of masses too, and they don’t have those electrical pulses but they’re a part of the universe just like me. Do they have a consciousness too? A counterpoint is that a rock can easily be split into many rocks, and who knows what would happen then to its consciousness. An object is a concept created by humans, and really not a single thing in this world is separate or together beyond our arbitrary judgment. Therefore there are a couple possibilities:\n 1.\t⁠The universe doesn’t care whether I’m one thing or not, and nothing is conscious or not conscious. My experience breaks no rules. there is no afterlife. I either just stop existing when I die, or I relive the instant I die forever never moving in time again but similarly never  thinking again so it doesn’t matter\n2.\t⁠Beyond my brain which holds my thoughts, there is a further being that experiences those thoughts. What someone might call a soul which might go to heaven or hell, reincarnate, or experience any sort of thing for eternity after its host can no longer sense anything or make any thoughts that the soul can experience. After life there is something\n3.\t⁠World is a simulation blah blah blah but the afterlife kind of repeats after you wake up from the simulation too lmao\n4.\t⁠There is some kind of thinking power somewhere other than the brain, or in the brain but that’s not the same as the neurons firing, meaning that you can still think and or sense things after death.\n5.\t⁠This is honestly pretty plausible in my mind. When you die, you stop thinking, there is no experience or soul left behind, but because you can’t process time, you wake up again instantly. You don’t have any memories of the past life, and you can’t think any new thoughts, all of your memories were lost when you died and your body stopped sending electric pulses, but an infinite amount of time passes in an instant, the universe reached its end and started reversing (as some believe) or keeps progressing passing through every possible state of existence matter could be in (or perhaps not every possibility but some loop) where I exist infinite times as the same person living the same inevitable life. (I would say parallel universe lives could be possible, if it weren’t for the fact that not every small change of things is possible in our universe that has deterministic results based on a specific input. Basically I’m saying that while we can think of infinite “results” (ways the universe is in 2025 right now) those aren’t all guaranteed to have a combination of hydrogen atoms at the time of the Big Bang that could result in that future, or even in humans existing at all. There is a reason I am so fixated on there being “something”. No matter what happens after life, your life still exists in time. I’m not talking about in memories, those are after all temporary. I’m talking about if we weren’t beings that only went forward, and we had a graph of the whole universe over time, no matter how much time passes, you are still there, on the graph, as a blob that exists in time from right when you were born till the day you die “forever” unless some timeless being changes that. While that truth still exists and gives the me of now some comfort in dying and not being able to think ever again, what do you know, I still don’t want to die and not ever think ever again. I want to have my thoughts to appreciate my world so far, my memories, those who come after me, and the universe and I want to be able to contemplate for an eternity. That’s why I really don’t care if I go to paradise or eternal suffering, because while suffering I can still appreciate, I can still love even those who aren’t with me. It would be lonely, sure, but I would have myself. Sometimes when I’m crying thinking about death I’ll tell myself I love you. I’m not saying it to the same me that thought to say I love you (my body and my mind that resulted in those thoughts). I’m saying it to the experience. I’m saying it to the soul that I don’t even know exists that will last so much longer than my personality that I have now (maybe). And I love you too. I love you because you exist, and someday your body will not, and you are just like me. And thinking about being alone makes me so sad. So sad that in the future, so many years ahead that I haven’t even lived half of my life yet, that I might be alone without even myself to console me, and without even my thoughts to be sad. I want so bad to get over this, and I want to be sad at other things so that I can forget about death but I can’t, because every time I do I find myself happy that I’m not thinking about death anymore, and then start thinking about death again. And I can’t spend so much time in this fucking cycle because I just can’t sit still. While I know what may or may not be beyond my lifespan I just can’t sit still and wait for my life to pass me by because my one life might be all I have. I want fulfillment so bad. I want to live the best life the most happy for the most time. The most human, surrounded by the people I love and experiencing all the things life has to offer. I want to make all of the memories, and I don’t want to forget. I want my brain to last forever so it can, so I can rack over those memories infinite times and I want to make new memories loving, and being loved, and learning and doing things. I’m so afraid of death because it’s so inevitable and yet it’s so unknown. I want to believe in eternal life through genetic modifications but as much as I hope and hope it’s never guaranteed. It pisses me off when my mom tells me she “just knows” that there’s an afterlife. She says she can feel it and she guarantees it, she just knows. But I know she doesn’t know even though she believes she knows because humans lie and they lie to themselves. And as much as they say they guarantee and as much as they make stories that they say transcend the page and alter reality to their will it’s not a guarantee and it’s just hope no matter what you feel. I love my mom the most because she gives me hope. She taught me that when I’m feeling this way to focus on where I feel in my body. It works well to control my sadness. But all it does is attempt to control my chemicals, my brain. I mean that’s exactly what I want to do, no matter what I do the fact of what’s at the end won’t change so the optimal course is to use this brain to live the happiest life I can, and maybe leave some stuff for the people after me and be kind to my neighbors. But that’s just it. I can’t change the fact. And that’s why it keeps coming back to make my course suboptimal. To make my life one where I’m not getting the most fulfillment possible because I’m sitting on the fucking floor contemplating about something I can’t change. I said I wanted advice but I also wanted to rant so no matter who looks at this whether it be one person, thousands, or no one at all, thanks for listening to my thoughts and I’d love to hear yours.",

    "selftext": "This may be a rant, but I have to put this somewhere. I’m 24, and I feel like that’s pretty young, but also like my life is already over. I was never pretty. As a kid, I acted out and got in trouble often, practically lived on my Nintendo. As a black girl in a very white town, some isolation was expected. \n\nMy parents were abusive, but also covert. My father would do my hair so tight and brush so hard that my hair would fall out in bloody clumps, hitting me with the brush because I was ‘tender headed and pulling away’. Everyone believed him. My mother would pinch me with her nails constantly, she’d put me in shoes two sizes too tight, then harass me for bleeding through my tights at the heel. There’s hundreds of examples like this. I  can’t remember a time of my life that I wasn’t at least passively suicidal. I hated myself so much that I avoided mirrors.\n\nMy middle school art teachers saw that I had some talent. They even gave me an easel and a set of paints when I graduated, and teared up when it was time to say goodbye. I put my head down in high school, got good grades. But my mental health was still bad. I didn’t put any effort into my appearance. Art was my life, that was it. My art teachers said I had real potential. \n\nI told my parents I wanted to go to college, art school, and it took years of fighting before they let me even look at schools. I told my teachers (the first time being fully transparent about what was going on at home) and they sat me down and helped me with my portfolio, even buying supplies for me. I applied to Pratt, CalArts, Massart, SCAD, Cooper Union, and RISD. I got into all six.\n\nI ended up choosing RISD. I met some of the most wonderful people. They liked me, but were confused as to why I took no pride in myself. I made friends, other black femmes, and they encouraged me. They helped me to find myself. Through this, and an extremely late puberty… I got hot. Shapely hips, nice breasts, round ass, you name it. I put effort in, and started taking care of myself. People started to notice.\n\nThen Covid hit. We all got sent home. Everything was closed and my older parents didn’t want to risk exposure, so I was kept inside. I didn’t want my father to touch my hair, but in my depression, I didn't take care of it properly and I looked a mess again. I threatened to lock myself in the bathroom with my father’s clippers and do what I needed to do. \n\nEventually, he sat me down, and I was shorn. My parents said I looked like a boy, that I was crazy even asking for this. My mother scoffed and said I didn’t have the face to pull it off. But something clicked for me. I felt more feminine and pretty than ever before. Happy, sometimes, even.\n\nBut there was something wrong. I couldn’t focus on my work the way the other kids did. I struggled to submit my assignments, even to find the motivation to. I was also dealing with what I now know to be a laundry list of chronic illnesses. I had one good day to ten bad days, but the good days were wonderful.\nStill got good grades. Got my style back on track. \n\nI ended up being approached by a friend in apparel- to model. I was shocked, but I agreed. Modeling was something I never considered possible, but somehow, I took to it. More people approached me to model for them, shoot after shoot. I did some local professional work and at every turn, was told I could go far. This was world changing for me. I never thought I could be beautiful to anyone, even to myself before college. \n\nSomehow, I graduated. I had few prospects, and didn’t have the same drive as my peers. I got a day job at an art store so I could do something related to my passion that paid my bills. I got myself into a nice apartment with a studio, where I live now. \n\nI’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, hypothyroidism, I have fibroids, an estrogen and severe iron deficiency. My kidneys and stomach are shot from years of NSAID painkillers for my dysmenorrhea (excruciating cramps that would leave me bedridden for a week out of each month, if left unmedicated). I have GERD, and all of this culminates to taking so many pills. So many.\n\nMost days I still struggle to make work and get out of bed. Which leads to a vicious cycle of self-blame, creative stagnation, and self-hatred. \n\nThe thing is… it’s the same as before. That one wonderful day I get every twelve days or so? I’m genuinely grateful for it. Even though I’m sick, I don’t feel sick, because of all the medications I take. I’ve never had so many modeling deals. I constantly get asked if I have an agent, told to go to modeling calls. I’ve been featured in Vogue twice. People stop me on the street. I’ve had designers and boutique owners run out of their stores to catch me on the sidewalk. I can eat what I want (what my frail body can handle) pretty often and I don’t exercise other than light yoga and my walk to work. I’m in the best shape of my life. Men ask me out, even when I’m working at the store in my comfy clothes and no makeup. But I feel undeserving of romance.\n\nI know I have a long way to go. I know it’s going to be an uphill battle. Hell, I didn’t even really plan to be here after I graduated. My grandmother, who was my driving force for even staying alive, died in September of 2022. She told me to go after my dream, and I did. My friends from RISD went to pursue their dreams all over the world, and we all dissolved into our own adult lives after college. \n\nI’m not sure what to do now. My new doctor, who has taken my problems seriously, has pushed me to get therapy. I know I need it. But whenever I go to fill out the form, I get scared. Scared that my childhood of being treated like I was less than human is to blame for all this. That some guy in an armchair is going to tell me that the dark shadow that looms over me can’t be defeated with medication, that it’ll be here, eating my dreams and squandering my potential, forever in my ear telling me I’m not good enough.\n\nI put so much work into becoming a swan. Why do I still feel like the ugly duckling?\n\n\n\n\n",

It feels like my head is on fire from all the nasty thoughts creeping in and I have to take a cold shower just to calm down. When she’s with her I always try to distract myself by meeting someone or doing anything to avoid thinking. I’ll do anything sometimes something self-destructive just to deal somehow. I’ll take a scalding hot bath call my best friend and talk about absolute nonsense for hours. Anything. \n\nI hate that bff, and my girlfriend knows it. She might not realize the full extent but she knows from the countless times I’ve told her and from how I act after they meet. I don’t blame her for not cutting her off and I won't ask her to because I don’t want to see her suffer. It would hurt me more to see her depressed from losing someone I hate. Thinking about it makes me want to throw up. I know they’re close. I know she loves her, probably more than she will ever love me but at least sometimes I can pretend it isn’t true.\n\nYesterday I knew nothing else would make me feel better. I needed something to destroy me so completely that I won't form a single thought. So I overdosed on pills. At first it wasn’t enough to seriously poison me just enough to vomit and feel utterly miserable. After an hour I was still thinking about her, so I took more. Still not enough to kill me just enough to knock me out. \n\nI went to sleep and I laid on my back, half hoping that I would choke on my own vomit in my sleep and won't open my eyes again. When I woke up my mouth was full of vomit my legs were like cotton. I started vomiting straight onto the carpet. It was the good kind of pain, the one that made me struggle physically but my mind wasn't operating.\n\nI tried to get to the toilet but I fainted halfway. I woke again I couldn't get up, covered in vomit and diarrhea. My floor was a disgusting mess of black shit and pill vomit. I switched between barely conscious and blackout every few seconds. Eventually, I passed out again on my way to get paper towels. When I woke up lying on the cold tiles of my kitchen floor I felt the most peace I had in months. Imagine a life so miserable that being passed out in your own filth feels like the most relief you’ve had in a long long while. \n\nI don’t know how long I was out. When I woke ip again was a bit better. I cleaned myself the floor changed clothes and slept through the whole dayexcept for one time I woke and fainted in the hallway. It worked. I don’t regret it. I didn’t think about her or anything else because my body forced me to stop. My brain went silent. For a little while, I surrendered. \n\nEven after waking, I was too exhausted to think, too weak to stand. I’ve been suicidal half my life, but I rarely act on it. Yet I know that if I were on the brink, I wouldn’t fight it. I would accept it. And when I woke again, I regretted not taking moretaking enough to knock myself out, but not forever. I already know I’ll do it again. Because for a little while, everything is quiet. On those cold tiles I could feel relief and that’s all I need. ",

At this moment I always see a smile spread across my face. Not because I want to die, but because I will have completed the cruel game of life. If I die now or in 50 years I think the only thing I’ll feel is relief. Like I made it to the finish line. I didn’t forfeit or give up. I didn’t end my journey early. I existed until I didn’t have to anymore. \n\nHow do I find solace in a life I never enjoyed?",

    "selftext": "\nI'm experiencing the biggest pain of my life right now and I need some advice, comfort or some similar experiences. I'm sorry in advance for my broken english (and for the endless paragraph). \n\nMy story:\n\nI (27) started dating my ex-girlfriend (24) in april 2024 and after a month of seeing eachother i wanted to made it official and be a couple. I loved her (and still do). It was the best day of my Life.\nThe first months, until february 2025, were perfect, i can't stress it enough. Everything. But, starting March 2025, my mental health got worse (i know It seems like an excuse, but it's the actual truth), and I started seeing negative things in the relationship even where everything was just fine. Everything was perfect, but I was too stupid to see it. \nI started detaching, slowly, even though I still loved her with all my heart. I didn't let her enter my \"world\", i didn't let her help me, i was being cold for absolutely no reason. And everytime She asked \"what's wrong\" i didn't have the answer for her. I didn't communicate with her. March and april, i tried to not show all this, to be strong for her, but It got progressively worse to the point I decided that breaking up was the best option. Even though i was trying to heal.\n\nSo I did it mid july. \nShe was broken but she knew. \nI failed her, I destroyed everything with my own hands. She was the best things that ever happened in my life, I still dream (like i used to) a future with her, because she will always be the one. And I pushed her away because i couldn't recognize how lucky I was and how I truly loved her. It's all my fault.\n\nAfter the breakup I already knew i made a mistake. But i waited a month, out of pure respect for her. \n\n- (I started seeing a therapist)\n\nI texted her August 20th, 2025. I told her everything. She agreed to call, the same night. We spent 3 hours on the phone and I poured my heart out. I apologized to her, because i knew I hurt her. \n\nShe then agreed to see me. At her house. So i went to her house, and, once again, poured my heart out. I told her everything. That I hurt her even before the break up, that I know I made a mistake leaving her and that she won't see that side of me ever again. I know it sounds lame, but i am sure about it, like i've never been in my life. I love her. \n\nShe said she can't right now, that she is confused and she doesn't know what to think. She is still attached to me, but she doesn't know if the love is still there. \"Even if i Say yes, we have to rebuild everything, and right now i don't know if I'm strong enough\", said. \n\nThen, she started hugging me and we spent 2 hours cuddling, little kisses, laughing. It was the best. \n\nBut After that, she still said the same thing. That she was still hurt and She remembered how hurt She was beforse the actual breakup. I did and said everything in my power that i changed for the Better and that i made stupid mistakes. I treated in a horrible way. But I wanted to make things right. But It wasn't enough. \n\nWe cried like Crazy. She didn't want me to leave but i had to. I left her a letter i wrote the night before. And i said i loved her for ever. Because it's the truth. I just needed a last, small chance. \n\nSo i left. I wrote her by text one last thing and She said she need time. She then texted me (right after) \"i have a question, you can think about It, don't answer yet: do you like your life?\". \n\nIt sounds really generic, but this Is what she means: if i'm doing good, that to her means that maybe i won't hurt her again. That i have my life togheter. \n\nAnd i do now, i know it's Just 1 month, but i do. \n\"You miss the positive things, you miss the experiences ecc.\" - no, \n\nI miss her, the person.\n\nI told her \"i will respond, but i need to rest\". She agreed with me, that we have to rest and this Is the last text she sent (two days ago, and i didnt reply).\nI genuinely don't know what to do. I know I sound desperate, but she means the world to me, and I can't let her go. I treated her horribly, it's all my fault. But I can't go on knowing she isn't with me.\n\nShould I respond now? Should I try to meet again (this is the thing i'd like the most tbf)? Should i wait? \n\nAnything would help right now. Thank you. \n\n\nTl,dr: I BROKE UP WITH MY GF, AFTER 3 MONTHS OF ME BEING DISTANT. I REGRET IT NOW BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYMORE. ",

I am constantly 'on' and can go to the gym sometimes but then I panic or stress for nothing. Also, several people say that I have lost weight but not that I notice (I have an eating disorder/am in recovery). I find it very confusing because I see that I have gained weight. It's hard to just ignore this but I'm getting better at it. I also had a very difficult year past year where in my last two years as a student I had a big fight with my mom, was very deep in eating disorder, suicidal thoughts. The stress is just too much for me I think and now to have the feeling that I have gained weight and old thoughts that occur... I am afraid that I will want to diet again while I know that this is not a solution. I don't know right now and I am very stressed right now. I just bought a tramadol from a friend because I want to feel a bit more drowsy. Lately I have also been thinking more and more about drinking alcohol. I just feel too much all the time. I am mike ovvveerrr sensitive for others feelings, thoughts, emotions... My hands shake a lot, fine motor skills are hard, I have brain fog and am extremely forgetful. Every day I don't want to come home because of the feeling I have, this constantly intern turmoil. Sometimes I also feel like I'm panicking a bit, my legs get very hot then. I tried meditation, stretching, pilates, walking... it helps but only for the time I'm doing that. What should i do ir try next? Maybe medication would help? ",

I feel ugly and I flip flop between trying to get stronger and emaciated myself just to feel like I fit in. I don't really have any friends and it's tearing me apart inside. I don't want to live, I don't see any reason to keep going, I dont have anyone who would care besides my family and shayna. I had nobody to go to when my dad passed, nobody to lean on, nobody to talk to. Shayna unfortunately didn't understand which wasn't her fault. I just keep all that sadness, all that pain and despair bottled up no matter what. I feel like my existence is just a speck of black mold on the world, like it needs to go away, it needs to be eradicated, like a cockroach. Yes, that is what I feel like. A slimy, shiny, scuttering, chittering, loathing, yearning, groaning cockroach. I look around to see others with their friends having a good time, having fun, those connections, never for me. Never for ME, to feel the embrace of a good friend as they comfort me. Never for ME to laugh and stay out late with people I care about. Future me, if you're reading this, I really hope you found your people. I really really do, life feels pointless now. I know I should keep going but I really don't want to. I don't think shayna loves or likes me anymore. I have this horrible pain and anxiety in my chest that I dont think is going away anytime soon. I just want my dad, I want to talk to him. Why did he have to go, he was too young, he still had so much to teach me. I miss his warmth and his hugs. When he would call me to ask me how i'm doing. I'm afraid Shayna doesn't  like me anymore, or wants me around anymore. I feel like clutter, like someone's collection that they grew out of. This feeling is so devastating, so heavy on my soul and heart. Shayna says that I need to go out and get some friends, but it's just not easy. I'm not extroverted like that. I can't do what she does, not easily, i don't even know if i'm worthy of love anymore. At work I act like everything is okay, I'm funny and caring towards others, I'm acquaintances with everyone and I get along easily with everyone but I never make a single friend. I'm so lost and sad, I hate myself and everything. I just want it to end. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Just have to vent a little bit about my emotions because I have literally no one to talk too, well I have Bryanna but all my emotions are literally for her so I can’t really say anything. I just can’t be happy anymore. I had a complete ego death and it’s hard to look at myself in the mirror and be happy with what I see. I just wish I can change everything, I’m happy I have a son and I love him with my whole heart but there’s just so much on my chest with his mother that I can’t literally never get off. Like I can’t say anything to her about it because it’s the past and even if I do she’s just gonna sit there like a lifeless mannequin and say nothing. I just hate how she thinks that the things we’ve done hold the same weight. Throughout out whole talking stage I only had sex with belle and Aniya, and Aniya was before I ever had sex with Bree and Belle was while we weren’t talking. Meanwhile she was fucking on me, Ayden, and Joey all at the same time, sometimes in the same day. But that’s not even the main grudge that I hold, the Mike situation still haunts me till this day. It just hurts to know how she was able to care so much about someone she met not long ago. Like the most I did was compliment and flirt with girls on snap and it never even led to anything, I would just compliment them then send a snap like nothing happened. But Bree was so invested in her little situation ship and her nor her friends understanding how much more weight that holds. Like why THE FUCK are you worried about him talking to other girls and shit? Why THE FUCK are u worried about how long ur on delivered for? Why THE FUCK are you having routine sex with this boy you just met literally a day after breaking up with me and then turning around and fucking me? Let alone texting it friends about, and SHE WAS PREGNANT THE WHOLE TIME!!!!!! But ig that holds the same weight as snapping girls and our roommates coming into our room, not even bedroom, just room. And then the text with the two loves of her life rocky and Joey like fuck😂 deadass talking to 3 dark skins that have the same archetype.(look NOTHING LIKE ME) And she looked me in my face AND LIED ABOUT IT ALL 🥀 put it on her family and everything. But ig im not the victim. I know she secretly doesn’t find me attractive and that hurts a lot, honestly she’s the reason for a lot of my mental issues. She does all this and then just acts like nothing happened, her and her friends actually call me childish for being sad about it 😂 and laugh about it 😂 they laugh at my pain, they make jokes about my reactions to songs are gonna be, they hurt my feelings a lot. I just hate how I invested so much in her, I trusted her too much, I thought we were all good after belle and Ayden but nope, her ahh still goin. I just wonder who else she’s been with and hasn’t told me about, it’ll hurt to know but I just wonder who else. We are too different to see eye to eye. I hold emotions and sex at a way higher level than her and that’s one of the main problems with us. It’s just gonna be so weird if I ever talk to another girl. I had a complete personality change since being with her and I became way more awkward around people since we’ve started talking. I honestly don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’ve thought about committing suicide but that’s so extra and not worth it, but some times I’m hurting so bad that that’s all I can think about. I don’t think I’m the type of person to but idk. I wonder if most people that I’ll themselves do it without planning. I think if I kill myself it will definitely be spontaneous and have no thought behind it fr. But that’s unlikely. Is it normal to think like this? Idk maybe. I wonder how different my life would’ve been if I just never went back or if we never had a baby. I don’t regret the baby or anything I just want to see how things would have been. Would I be happy? Would I be less socially awkward? Would I still be me? I hate that she really doesn’t care about my feelings. Like I do so much to make sure she’s happy and doing okay but she just can’t return the favor, but she says she loves me, buys me things, and even asked me out once. But is this just manipulation or something, like does she just keep me here because I treat her good? I think about this a lot but then like this girl be complaining about me a lot so like what the fuck. I lowkey think I should go to a therapist or something to just debrief. I wonder how much longer I can go with all these sad feelings about her on my chest. I wonder if I’ll ever snap and do something I might regret.",

    "selftext": "Hi, I’m a minor who identifies as she/her and will not be disclosing my age. Better grab some popcorn, cause your in for a treat\n\nRecently a girl in my class who I’m not close to, but friends to recently decided to tell us that she will un-alive herself if she is not included in my close friend group (abbreviation “fg”), aka most people would call it “Fg A”. \n\n It all started when last year, my close guy friend, we will call him “Mike”. Mike has this mentally challenged cousin how attended my school and would constantly stalk my fg (my close fg consists of 4 girls including me + Mike) and would constantly saying and do things that disturbed us, like how he would rape us and other things I will not mention. So, 2 of the 4 of us in the fg, we will call Marisa and Sofia, decided to report Mike’s cousin’s behavior to one of his teachers. Next period, they pulled me and Sofia instead of Marisa since they couldn’t find her or something idk. They sent us to the principals office and made us talk face to face with Mikes cousin. After that, the assistant principal called our parents. \n\nSofia and I are straight A students, however, Sofia has very strict parents, so this instantly went South for her. Her parents forbade her to see my friend Mike ever again, while my mom told me to be careful. \n\nSo, after this incident, everything turned upside down. Sofia started to act mean towards Mike, always verbally pushing him out of our lunch table, saying stuff like “You ugly rat, we don’t want you here” and just generally being bully, and at the same time, verbally hurting us too. Again, we didn’t want any trouble and report this to the school, so we stayed silent for a while. After planing in my group chat, we decided to confront Sofia about her behavior. It didn’t work. We tried multiple times and had lots of talks with her, but she wouldn’t change. So one day, I was in a group call with a friendly trouble maker, who wasn’t that close to me, but attended my club. Mike and Marisa vented to the Troublemaker, which we will call Eliza, and then a plan was made. We were going to plan to prank Sofia by pretending to be her stalker. \n\nYes, this wasn’t the best plan, but we were pissed at Sofia. Since Sofia didn’t have Eliza’s \nnumber, they decided to use her number to pretend to be a secret admirer. Halfway through the plan, I realized what we had done. I realized that is we were caught, I was surely done for. After rambling to my friends in the call to not include my name in anything, I left the call. After that, the call was busted. And then, Sofia was officially, out of the friend group\n\nThe next year came around, and Mike moved to an elite private school. So, it was just Marisa, and I, plus the fourth girl I haven’t named in this story, let’s call her Bell. We friended Sofia again, since she has changed, however, she was more of in “Friend Group B” than in the main one. \n\nOne day, we had a field trip, and Sofia now has a new friend, we will call her Samantha. Samantha is the past, had a rocky relationship with Sofia. Today, Samantha had look like she was mad at Sofia and refused to talk to her, but that wasn’t my business. Belle wasn’t able to go to the field trip, so it was just me and Marisa. In the field trip, Sofia vented to us about how Samantha was verbally abusing her and her own fg. Shocked, we asked her to explain. Sofia then explained how Samantha would randomly dump her trauma and problems on Sofia. For context, Samantha is suicidal, and has problems at home. So, Sofia obviously feels bad for her, and put up with her crap for months, not wanting to abandon her best friend. After that day, we thought that maybe Sofia should escape that toxicity and formally invited her to sit with us at lunch to recap and talk. \n\nThe day came, and Sofia arrived at the table where Belle, Marisa and I were waiting. We cleared everything up and told her she was invited to sit with us whenever she wanted, and basically, she was back to my main fg. That day, we even told her our current crushes to show her that we trusted her again, and she shared hers too.\n\nThings seem to be going smoothly, until Samantha started to show up uninvited to our tables and conversations. This wouldn’t be an issue if she had just asked. But she constantly tried to include herself in our fg, but we did not like her presence, so we caved into the idea of her staying partially close to us. \n\nAgain, problems arose, and Samantha appears to be very arrogant, always telling my friend Marisa what to do, like “You should work on _____ in math, since I think though need it for the test, I’m ready though” or “ I think you got group B, and I got group A.” (This group system was to classify your smartness for future applications, and a higher letter meant greater opportunities for applications) She was constantly arrogant and belittling Marisa, and obviously we did not like it. We decided not to do anything though, as again, she has problems at home, and is suicidal, and friend ship drama will only add to it. \n\nSofia and I stated to be very close again, and I occasionally listened to Sofia tell me about all the bad things Samantha has done, like make fun her other friends skills in sports and stuff, even though she has a learning disability. But in general, talks sh!t about her own friends often. So, today, Sofia sent me screenshots of shots of messages between her and Samantha, and how Samantha is going to un-alive herself to be the “good guy” and is threatening to do stuff to us, as she has done things to her ex-friends in the past. Also, it is scary how Samantha predicts stuff, like people’s absence and stuff. It’s scary. \n\nWhat do I do now? She is threatening to kill herself over my fg and threatening us in general? Do we allow her in? That will only make it awkward as she will seem to look like she forced the friendship onto us.\n\nThe thing is, I don’t have a problem with allowing her into our friend group, but the thing is, she’s just inviting herself. Friendships are made through memories, and close relationships, not through threats. \n\nP.S. Samantha has gone to counseling, but stoped because the “attention was annoying”\n\nAny advice now?\n ",

Don’t miss them really, just the memories from before they became jerks. I miss staying up late playing games with them, talking, goofing around, etc. I feel like a nobody. I’ve tried so many different clubs, events, outings, games, everything under the sun you could probably think of or recommend to me but still nothing. \n\nI think I just have rotten luck. My interests aren’t even that niche so being left alone and left out constantly makes me feel like even more of a freak. I’m autistic too so the loads of anxiety and depression that comes with it has been torture.\n\nI am so alone. \n\nI didn’t mean for this to turn into some semi-sounding suicidal rant but just wanted to vent. These feelings come in waves, sometimes I’m fine and can function while being alone but other days I’m just tired and sick of it. My birthday is coming up so that’s probably why I’m feeling so down because I already know it’s going to be like last year where I only really celebrate with my mom and have no one around me (my age) to celebrate or just hang out with.\n\nThe only thing that really helps is grass, but eventually I crave the need for human connection. Just one friend I can talk to and not be ghosted by. That’s what I wish for.\n\nSorry this got to be so long, this specific depression wave hit hard this time. \n",

Almost everyone i come into contact with thinks that. Im funny, im smart, im caring, but for some stupid reason when i moved to this new city I can’t make any fucking friends. Walking around the halls by myself is sooo depressing. \n\nI’ve gotta go through almost every class by myself and the only “friends” i have here is my coworkers. All my real friends are either in another city or in other states and i can’t drive yet. I feel so stuck. and what makes matters worse is that my only friend fr was my gf at the time and all of her friends were my friends. She was the only person i walked in the halls with, we had a whole routine and everything. And then she breaks up w me cs she’s not ready for a rls and now ive gotta see either her, her sister, or one of her friends every where at school and it’s just like a thousand punches in the chest everyday at skl. \n\nPlus I live in a small town and i hate towns like this because im from new york and im used to just being able to go wherever whenever but here in fl you gotta drive everywhere. She had a car and just in general she was the only person i went out with now im stuck in the house 25/7 losing my mind (which makes it ten times harder to heal from this shit). \n\nBeing alone with my own thoughts as someone with bad depression and suicidal tendencies is not fun. Not only do i miss her but i dont even have any friends fr to take my mind off of it. And even outside of her i feel so worthless and lonely without any friends, it makes me feel like Theres something wrong with me but i know there isnt. And ive always dreamed of having an amazing high school experience, going to parties, football games, concerts, hanging out with people. And now my high school life is almost over and im stuck as a heartbroken loser. Sure im introverted and kinda quiet when im alone but thats never stopped me from making friends before. \n\nIm genuinely just rambling but If anyone has any tips on how to make friends please 🙏🏾 im actually desperate.

I never had actual friends as a kid, just pre-established friend groups I would latch on to that just passively accepted that I was there and would forget that I exist the rest of the time. I live in the middle of nowhere now and my coworkers all keep to each other and themselves, nobody lives here that doesn't have to so the only real options for socializing are my coworkers that are all indifferent to me at best or the crackheads in town. My family doesn't call or text me unless I call them first or it's some big holiday like thanksgiving or christmas. I have only one friend over the internet that's been getting more and more distant cause he's getting married and moving to canada. I live on a cycle of work, come home, play video games for a couple hours, eat whatever crap I have in my fridge, go to bed, repeat, and then just do nothing on the weekends or when I'm forced to take my PTO since it looks bad on my boss to his boss if we don't. I've effectively been isolated from the world and people around me my entire life and lately it's been getting to me and I go through these cycles of being completely fine for a while and then being completely dejected and feeling like a useless sack of shit that did this all to himself. Yes I know that realistically I did in fact do this to myself but it's been this way my entire life and the way I see it there's nothing to even be done about it anymore. This is just the person I am and this is just the way things are. I know I'm not going to kill myself or anything retarded like that but I'm just stuck in a purgatory like state and it's never going to end. In a way I've at this point just resigned myself to it, I know nobody likes being around me and even now I still have no idea why but at this point I can't bring myself to care enough to try and do anything about it anymore because what is there to do? I've been getting along just fine by myself to this point, so why reach for something I have no actual frame of reference for? I know that instinctually my brain is trying to physically tell me I need to connect with other people, that's why I feel like shit over it, I get that, but psychologically or consciously or whatever I know that's never going to happen. I don't want some sappy overly emotional BS about how I need to just get out there or just talk to people. I do not want that. If there's anyone else here that's going through a similar situation to mine how do you cope with this yourself and learn to move past it? I know this whole little spiel isn't gonna actually explain the depth of my situation but hopefully that little summarization of the focus problem can get across what I want to get across.

Ik some ppl say that it’s putting a bandaid on a problem and yeah that’s fair but I think if an unhealthy coping mechanism brings u some relief and keeps u from wanting to die, it’s okay as long as it’s not a forever thing. I usually stop smoking when my life is going well and I’m happy but when I’m sad it’s the only thing that lifts that sadness. Honestly I think smoking has saved my life during some of my darkest periods where I genuinely wanted to kill myself and felt so sad and alone so I don’t think that quitting weed is the best thing to do while I’m in the midst of depression. My plan is to use it to get through this period of time and then when things get better quit. \n\nThat’s what I usually do anyways.

    "title": "5/10 My honest review of Burnout Paradise In 2025 after the 100% Completion (of the Paradise City)",
    "selftext": "\nSo this is my first Burnout game that i 100%ted. I bought it on sale for 5 euros.\n\nLet's start by explaining the 5/10 score\n\n-1 score for the atrocious and incredibly repetitive progression. Whoever made the progression needs to be publicly executed because this game didn't feel like a game more like a chore (atleast to me since i was aiming for achievements). There's no variety in events only 4 types of them and 5th just being time trials which I don't count really. The worst thing is how all events restart once you upgrade your license making you do them again , atleast the ones you completed before the elite license progression starts.\n\nWHO TF THOUGHT OF PUTTING SHOWTIME ON ALL ROADS AND ALSO AS A REQUIREMENT FOR THE FUCKING ACHIEVEMENT. Oh my god this was so painful doing it on all 64 roads. It's not fun after 2nd time. It's not as spectacular as something I've seen in Revenge from what i remember.\nAlso TIME RULES...\n\n-1 score for STUNT RUN and ROAD RAGE. The requirements for STUNT RUN at the late game are fine but when half of the cars in the game wont turn because they weight 69 tons it's really bad(also AI loves to dive into you) I fucking let out a tear doing these. Gold Prestige mode in NFS 2015 is more easier than these events. Road rage is just repetitive after few of them because you do the same shit in races just without the CAP you need to hit in order to exit the event. They are here to prolong the length of the game. You can't catch up with AI when you want to while using boost because they'll ruberband to be ahead of you.\nMarked man and Races are good.\n\n-1 score for the soulless open world and a creepy atmosphere. The whole world feels absolutely dead. I guess Burnout just doesn't fit in open world or the execution was really bad.\n\n-1 score for suicidal ai and their uneven difficulty.\nI got traumas from traffic cars in this game constantly diving into me. Race ai is weak compared to Marked man ai for example which is absolutely insane. Road rage ai just runs away from you...\n\n-1 score for the cars behavior...sticking to the walls once the front side of the car is touching it. When you try to turn right or left the car can't move away from the wall and keeps getting glued to it. Also incredibly slow reversing time on all cars. Like what the fuck?! Why is it so slow?\n\nEverything else is alright but these small things really ruin the experience for me. This is a unique game and i love it but it's really irritating sometimes.\n\nI love the handling but only on race cars. I really don't get the point of the aggression class because you can use race cars and stunt cars for road rage and marked man. Also aggression class drives like shit.\n\nSoundtrack list is nice.\n\nBikes are a nice addition. Big Surf Island is great too with all of it's DLCs.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask.",

    "selftext": " I believe I was 15 or 16, I wanted to splatter my brains on the wall with a shotgun I'd been gifted for my birthday. The moment I held it in my hands my first thought was \"This is perfect for shooting myself\". I hated myself so much and saw no point in living. The only reason I'm still here is because on those nights I was too much of a coward to pull the trigger. I did load it, chamber a round and put it underneath my chin, but I was too scared to do it.\n\nSometimes I get thoughts of doing it again. Depression never truly goes away it just sits and waits in the background until something slightly unfortunate happens then it floods itself into your mind again.\n\nI thought about killing myself everyday, at school, at home, at family events, etc. I still think about sometimes, when I have a slight inconvenience or a bad day, it will slip in for a moment. Other times it will linger all day and not stop, I want to kill myself sometimes but I can't leave (significant other), I could never do that to her. Imagining that she'd end her life because I did the same to mine hurts so much and I couldn't do that to her. No matter how much of a bad day I have or how irritated or depressed I get, I won't do it because she's still here. If she ever leaves me, I'm doing it within days. Sometimes I feel like she forgets how much she means to me and if she were to leave me I'd get my shotgun and blow my fucking face off. I don't care and anyone else but her, without her I am nothing. She is the main reason I'm still alive today.\n\n(I cleaned up the typos, punctuation, and grammar to make it legible. As well as redacted the name.)\n\nI think I had like 4 or 5 beers last night, I don't really remember. I'm 21yo and I work hard for her as well as for what I have. During my childhood I was a very isolated child, not social, autistic, bullied, etc. My parents fought everyday, verbally and physically. They emotionally neglected my brother and I so now that I'm grown I feel like I'm still learning how to interact with people. The way people look at me or react to what I say or what I do makes me feel like I'm a freak or not even human. I've had anxiety since I was a child and have been stressed almost everyday of my life. I feel like an asshole because I'll say things or ask questions and people will think I'm being an asshole and get upset with me, including my girlfriend. I feel as though because of the way I am she will get tired of me eventually. The only thing I ask of y'all is will it get better? As I get older, more mature, experience life and learn how to deal with my issues, will it get better? Will I stop hating myself?",

    "selftext": "I am 23M, i feel so lost in life, I don't even see the point to it anymore. One year ago i was severely suicidal I was so close to doing it but something went wrong. After that, I desperately clung to the idea that life can and will get better if i try. So i started trying to do things to improve my life. Now, after acknowledging the fact that even if i wanna die, i still wanna live so its less about wanting to die, and more about not believing I have a life.\n\nAnyways, right now, I am in melbourne, living with my father and my plans to improve my life went down the drain. I have had this condition where I feel pain around my right hip/lower back, so I went to my gp, got referrals for MRI'S, CT, but they failed to discern the problem. Then I went to a physiotherapist, which kind of improved the muscular pain I felt around that area, but then my nerve started hurting like hell, so I took pills for it. Its kind of relaxed right now but I still have the discomfort of having l5 sacralization and lower back muscular imbalance and a bit of scoliosis. \n\nThing is, even if I wanted to, I can't do any physically demanding job, as I have a lateral pelvic tilt and the sacralization, so everything just destroys me. When i came here, I worked as a waiter for 6 months and that completely destroyed me, I was tolerating the pain but it kept getting worse so I eventually stopped. Now I dont know what to do, i could go to uni next semester but idk what to do, i have 0 motivation, i think everything is pointless, i feel like i want either something to just kill me or that something would happen to the world and erase like 99.8% of the population so that I would be free to go and do whatever so I can finally start living again. I despise society, i see it only as a system that uses humans as cogs. But even on a more subconscious level, without our current system, humans have a system, just like ants do and so on and so on.... point being I see everything as purely animalistic. Everyone is shallow and pretends not to be. Society has made it so to live you need money, it's an imposed system. I am not gonna say it is wrong, right or wrong has nothing to do with this. My point is that I didn't choose to be born in this, and I hate that my only reality is existing within this pile. I also blame society because of my suffering. No I am not going with \"victim mentality\" on this, but I suffered growing up because my mother was crazy. She and my dad divorced, she cheated, and she would expect me to pick her side when I didn't even want to pick a side and just mind my own business. So she would always scream at me, daily, not letting me do anything, she would always threaten me, badmouth me, badmouth others, if i closed the door in my room and had headphones on she would barge in and come to take them off. Her screaming voice was especially loud, I felt I was going insane just listening to her voice. She even hit me. I reached my limit many times, and I decided to hit back but obviously that wouldn't go well on her side. So she would always say things like: I wish u were never born, if u dont do this, i'll call the cops, did your father convince you to believe that? Did ur father teach u that?( my father was in a different country). So yeah, she was especially paranoid, thought everyone was against her, so she saw me not picking her side as being against her. She called the police on my brother, my grandfather, her brother(unc),almost on aunt, and on me 3 times. Even the police knew she was retarded. But to me, there's nothing I could do except be stuck with her, driving me insane daily. I couldnt take it anymore. My anger was so intense that I wanted to do matricide. After lots of repressed anger and trying not to get aggressive with her, I became severely depressed. And as life continued, I understood that the reason I was socially awkward and I failed in my love life as I was mildly depressed back then, was because of her. All the realizations that everything in my life has went wrong and continue to go wrong because of her infuriates me to an unimaginable degree. My point is that if not for society, I wouldnt be forced to experience all of that for all those years as I could have just offed her. But ye it became directed towards myself because theres nothing I could do. My hobbies and my dreams were crushed, because she just wouldnt let me do anything.\n\n(So far i've said lots of bad things about my mother but my father wasnt a good father either, nowhere near as bad, but i did need a father and ofc he was absent, and everytime i tried to connect he would just warn me about doing things, like dont do that, with an angry voice even though I never showed anything indicating that I would do such things, and he would be constantly dissapointed in my brother, which he would also appoint to me as well. He would always speak in plural. So yeah because i reached rock bottom, i left my previous home and came here with him in melbourne 1 year ago. To this day, he still makes fun and questions anything I do, eg gaming, just doesnt let me exist in peace. He even questioned my sexuality multiple times even though i kept saying im straight. He cant respect personal space, and he cannot understand that if you constantly not let me do the things I wanna do then obviously I also wont do the things I dont wanna do. Its like i can never relax. And the worst thing is he is not aware of what the issues are even though i told him multiple times, so i just keep my mouth shut. I do feel love for him because he is my father but i dont like him as a person, i dont like being near him. I dont want family in my life anymore, and i cant escape it. I had a plan to become at least temporarily independent but it failed. But ive continuously reached breaking points again and again. Its not just a matter of problems, its also existentialism. I dont think I have a future but even if I did, so what? How is there a meaning to that? Why do it? So what if I had a better, happier life? What purpose would that serve? Im only forced to compromise because theres no control over reality. \n\nI dont see a reason to study hard, work hard, get a home, get a gf(unlikely),work, grow old and die. I dont want to be human anymore. I am sick and tired of my feelings, my rage, my sadness, everything that I've been forced to bottle up until now. And there is no reason as to why I had to endure all that. My hip pain had gotten so bad that I couldnt even exist in peace, it would even hurt while in bed, or sitting especially. I am not physically unfit, i've been doing calisthenics and weights for years, i've gone as far as bench 120kg for 5 so no, working out wont fix my issues. It does help with self image to a point if u dont have body dysmorphia, which I do(obviously). I also cant truly get over and move on from a girl of 6 years ago. It feels like she has become my forever type, like she is the chosen one. I kept creating scenarios inside my head for yeears and years, even knowing it is pointless. I am extremely limerent, obsessive, full of despair, and I live in my head. I havent really lived that much either, as I obviously had a lot of coping mechanisms(addictions) basically gooning and gaming or obsessing over some scenes in an anime( watching them over and over). So I dont know if theres even any work that I would like or that I can do. Everything seems exploitative. I've worked twice and both jobs worked me to my bone(eg 14 hours of rush hour kind inn a day).\n\nRight now I am just rotting in my room, dreading my existence, like always. And i hate being in the same home with my father. I also hate that i have to do things to maintain this miserable existence, like life already sucks ass, so why do i have to get hungry and work, to sustain what, THIS?",

    "selftext": "Depression was like carrying a weight that no one else could see. Some days, it was quiet, barely noticeable, just a dull fog over everything. Other days, it was heavy, suffocating, pulling me down into a place where even small tasks felt impossible. It wasn’t always sadness in the way people expected,it was emptiness, numbness, or a constant feeling that nothing would ever get better. I found myself trapped in thoughts that looped endlessly, questioning my worth, doubting myself, wondering why I even tried.\n\nBeing around people felt exhausting. I smiled, I nodded, I acted “normal,” but inside, I was drained, fighting a storm no one else could see. There were moments when I wished I could disappear from it all, escape the pressure, the expectations, the relentless heaviness in my chest.\n\nYet, even in the dark, there was a part of me that noticed the small flickers—a kind word, a moment of calm, a memory of something that had made me feel alive. It was fragile, but it was there, reminding me that I was more than that pain. Depression didn’t define me, but it followed me, shaping the way I saw myself and the world. Writing it down was was my way of letting it out, of giving voice to what was inside, even if it felt like no one would fully understand. There was a time when life felt unbearable, like every moment was filled with a weight I couldn’t carry, and the world around me seemed distant and meaningless. The pain inside me was constant, like a shadow I couldn’t escape, and thoughts of ending it all weren’t scary they felt like relief, a way to finally be free from the emptiness and despair that never left. I felt completely alone, even when people were near, because no one could see the storm raging inside me, and I didn’t want them to; it wasn’t about needing attention, it was about the crushing hopelessness that trapped me in my own mind. Everything that once mattered felt hollow, and even simple tasks became impossible, like moving through life under a heavy, invisible pressure that never lifted. There were moments when I almost gave in, when the darkness felt too big and permanent, and I couldn’t see any reason to keep going, but somewhere deep inside, faint and fragile, a tiny part of me refused to let go, holding me back from crossing a line I wasn’t ready to cross. That phase left scars I still carry, shaping how I see myself and the world, but it also showed me something I couldn’t understand then: that even in the deepest despair, when everything seems lost, a small spark inside can survive, fragile but persistent, and sometimes that is enough to keep you alive and moving forward, even if the light feels impossibly far away.                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\nwhen I believed that ending my life was the only way to make people see how much I cared, that maybe if I disappeared, they would finally feel guilty or realize what they had lost, but I came to understand that it wouldn’t change anything. People might feel sad or guilty for a day or two, but life goes on, and they will forget, while I would be gone forever, missing every moment I could have lived, every laugh, every small joy, every chance to feel even a little bit of happiness or love. I realized that my life mattered far more than the temporary guilt my death could cause, that staying alive, even in pain, was the only way to truly honor myself and the love I had to give. Loving others didn’t have to cost me everything no one benefits if I’m gone, and no one will ever see the truth of how much I suffered if I’m not here to live through it. If you’re reading this and feel like giving up, know that the feelings of despair will pass, that your presence has meaning even when it doesn’t feel like it, and that your life, every part of it, is worth fighting for because no one else can live it for you, and there are moments, people, and experiences that only you can witness and survive to see\n\nhope this will help",

    "selftext": "Few months ago (April) I was at my lowest.  My \"dear\" mother offered me to move in with her and my stepdad, saying she'll help me handle my child (who's autistic and has ADHD). I didn't have many options but to move in cause I was struggling financially and alot of other stuff was going on. \n\nSoon as I moved in, she started abusing me just like when I was a child. I'd sit on a porch at night, crying and looking at the road and picturing myself standing there and the car is running over me.\n\nOne day I've decided to reach out to my ex whom I stayed friends with. \nMy WhatsApp message didn't go through so I've tried Instagram. He didn't even read it. I've felt something was wrong and tried Facebook only to find out he died in February. I was completely shattered. I was at the park with my child and I don't even remember how did we get to my mother's house. \n\nHe had issues with drug addiction in the past but he was holding fine last year when we last spoke in August last year. We texted a little bit in October and he said he took Valium because his dog died. Due to my personal issues I didn't pay that much attention about Valium and I didn't get concerned.\n\nWe did agree we won't talk much anymore cause he started a relationship with a kind woman and since our story was unfinished we'd often talk how we miss each other and that wasn't fair to her. \n\n2 months ago I reached out to her to get some clarification on how he died and she said she didn't get insight in his autopsy results and that family said it was just a heart attack. When she showed me pictures of two of them they took few days before he died I could tell he got addicted again, he looked so tired, worn off and the light in his eyes was gone. She didn't notice it cause probably he was already hooked when they started dating and for her it was his regular look. \n\nNow I have a sense of guilt cause I didn't check up on him at all, all those months and asked about his addiction. I talk to his pictures alot and sometimes I get mad at him shouting \"why didn't you reach out\". Sometimes I'm just crying and being sad and wish I could talk to him at least one more time. \n\nWith everything that's happening in my private life (I've escaped from my mother's place after she pushed me when I was carrying a cup of hot coffee and burned myself), raising a child with special needs on my own, while me being neurodivergent and depressed, I'm sometimes suicidal and just wish I can join my ex even though I'm not religious or spiritual.\n\nI don't have access to therapy at the moment and won't have it for awhile. The only thing that's keeping me alive is the fact that my child is screwed if I leave. There's no institution who takes care properly for autistics in my country.

I also just can't seem to take in help at this point. After all, everything in this life is transactional. The help you seek is nothing more than the next check. The help you try to get by 'spiritual' sense is nothing more than lies that those people sell to you to buy as well. \n\nWhy did i fail to kill myself? I blame the religious aspect of hell scaring me out of it. Now I'm suffering every day, my thoughts keep lingering back to that moment that if I had jumped off, this would all end. I don't want to keep on living anymore. I don't want to feel angry or envy to those that get to laugh and enjoy life despite putting me through hell as a child.\n\nI just want to die, I failed. im damaged, im worthless. I wasn't born with the right upbringing to help me excel in life. \n\nI'm sorry for the rambling, I tried my best to not leak too much of my life to avoid anything being pointed to where i am now. I just needed to say this. I couldn't say this to anyone close to me but strangers are fine. So hopefully, I can gather the courage to kill myself and not pussy out.\n\n",

Otherwise I have bad relationships with my family which hurts my feelings a lot, but there is nothing I can do because some people are just fucked up beyond repair (many family members).\n\nWe moved multiple times during my upbringing, which caused my first wave of suicidal thoughts. I coped with alcohol and cigarettes, much like my family always recommended. But then I started lifting weights and for the first time in my life I felt a sense of purpose. I also started martial arts after a few years of lifting. Martial arts are the only thing that give my life any meaning, I would have killed myself without them. \n\nSo everything was great, great body and a mma badass.

Life has been a mess from the start. My parents divorced early, and both of them struggled with substance and alcohol abuse. Growing up, I never really felt like I belonged anywhere, my stepbrothers never saw me as family, and at school I was bullied, chased, beat up, and made fun of. That left me insecure, even though I tried to stay outgoing.\n\nBy my teens, I started rebelling—drinking, smoking weed—while also trying to please my parents. It didn’t matter, though. My mom left when I was young, I Guess that really had a huge effect on me. I started struggling with depression and second-guessing myself, and what was wrong with me and why she would wanna leave me and she did it for her own selfish reasons and I resent her for that. That basically ended up with me turning from a nice guy into something I didn’t want to be. Fast forward I started to gain an attitude and lash out (stemming from my mom leaving) this wasn’t good for me and my dads relationship. Both hot heads, with strong opinions and always wanting to be right. Over the years this grew us apart, he was never easy going he’s always been strict which heavily influenced my delinquent behaviour and when I turned 17 my dad kicked me out because I wouldn’t stop lying about smoking weed and not taking my meds. He was quick to rent out my room to someone else. Since then, I’ve basically been on my own. Right now, I’m homeless, living in a tent in the forest.\n\nI’ve made my own mistakes too—fell into drugs, gambling, and I ended up hurting people I really cared about. I’m deep in debt now with people I owe money to. I don’t see any way out. Even though I have work skills, quit gambling and drugs I can’t find the motivation to get up for a job when I know I’ve fucked everything around me. I just want to disappear and end it all.\n\nI feel like I’m not a good person anymore. I used to be, but somewhere along the way I lost that version of myself.

I’ve had severe depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation my entire life, also likely autism (still getting tested but it’s fairly certain), none of it was subtle, hell I literally told my mom when I was 8 that I “wanted to jump underwater and never come back up again” and she told me to “We do not talk about suicide in this household” so I didn’t. I remember wishing someone would break in and kill me just so it would all end, hell I still do. Anyways my fantastic life continued until middle of middle school when my parents decided to move me and my brother out of school and onto a boat to “travel the world” or some shit like that. I’ve always been terrified of water and hated boating to an extreme extent and my parents were WELL aware yet they did it anyways. Less than a year in my brother developed an eating disorder and overdosed in our shared bedroom. He barely survived and went into treatment for a year leaving me alone with my parents. I went down both coasts of the US and remember nothing of any of it. I didn’t take to drugs like my brother, I just locked down and counted the days till I could move out, told myself everything would be better then. We eventually ended up in Mexico, I don’t speak a lick of Spanish. I did make some friends there, one of which I even keep in contact with. All I remember from back then was how much my family ignored me. How when I turned to them for help they ALL ignored me. Despite sacrificing MY OWN wellbeing so my brother could get the attention he needs even he turned his back on me. All because of what? Because I yelled at a girl for repeatedly overstepping boundaries and severely bullying her brother who was my best friend. I still remember how everyone looked at me. How my brother looked at me, when I looked to him for help he returned my look with one of fear and disappointment. I remember seeing all my old classmates post online around that time about prom. Hell I probably wouldn’t have gone if I was there but shit not even having the option? As soon as I could I moved away for college. I thought everything would be better, that I could finally be happy. But I’m worse than ever. 2 months ago I was in a psych ward for trying to kill myself again and all I got out of it was some bad memories and some new meds (which I am taking diligently). After all this fight all I have to show for it is tears, scars, a missing memory, and a longing for a love and happiness it seems I’ll never receive. I doubt anyone will read this cause who the fuck cares, nobody ever has when I really needed it and now is no different. I really wish I knew how to give up. I’m ready for the next life if there is one. But for better or worse I’m incapable of offing myself. I just don’t want to have to fight from the second I open my eyes anymore. Every time I close my eyes I see that god forsaken boat. My brothers body and my moms cries. The looks everyone gave me when I stood up for my best friend against his sister. What was it all for. Even after all this people still ask me if I believe in god. If he does he will need to beg for my forgiveness cause all I have ever known is suffering.",

Been gaslighted, manipulated and went through every mental torture u can possibly think of. I am a deeply sensitive and emotional person that feels everything deeply. I am also an empath and i have major trust issues. We moved to canada and i healed for a bit. I reached out to my family that i needed professional help. They said it was too expensive and so i had to do my own healing and parenting cuz my parents and whole family sucks. Basically i dont have anybody to turn to and there was a time i begged God for a hug. When i thought everything was getting better, here i am, back in that dark place. So my dad is left in my home country and he doesnt wanna support us at all nor does he wanna come with us. My mom got into a relationship with this guy. We met the guy’s 2 kids one boy and one girl. The boy is the same age as me. At first, we were cool and i prayed and cried to God to let us stay with them and potentially move in with them. So my prayers got answered but it wasnt what i expected it to be. I am miserable. I have 3 siblings and they all get along so well with the guy’s 2 kids. I do too but i would get left out so much. The guy who was the same age as me, lets call him “A” basically he was very nice and sweet at first. Always helping me out even if i dont ask and following me around the house. Over time i realized maybe he kind of liked me and we did have tension and chemistry between us. He made it kind of clear because he was always staring at me and doing couple stuff like holding me by my waist, eating from the same thing, always close to me. I kind of liked him too and then he got a girlfriend. He was still doing that even tho he had a gf and when i said “is ur gf gonna be ok with u being this overprotective?” after he was holding my hand entagled and everything. He said we were platonic and that kind of hurt me but yeah i decided to distance myself abit cuz he had a girl. Then, he broke up with his girl and then was being more bold and touchy with me. Its partially my fault for folding and kind of reciprocating the same energy he was giving because it felt nice to be chosen for once or feel chosen and his eyes was always on me. I thought wow and then fast forward to now, we are living together. He turned cold. So cold. It all started when i called my guy friend and he called me fine shi and pretty and complimented me then A got mad. He yelled “Fuck you” to the guy as a joke apparently? then left the room after my guy friend complimented me. He was laughing trying to brush it off smiling but i could tell something was off. He started ignoring me and making mean jokes about me in front of everyone. I talked to him and said “are you mad at me?” and he said “uhhhhhh” i dont know how to feel about him. I said i couldnt fall for this guy because hes a walking red flag and i caught him multiple times lying down on my sister who was a year younger than me and being all close and touchy like the fuck? So i kind of called the guy friend on purpose bc i did not want him to be catching feelings because WE ARE LIVING TOGETHER. WE ARE ABOUT TO BE STEPSIBLINGS. Its so fucking awkward i cant even. I dont know how to act around him. Hes just so mean and im not even doing anything to him. Everything is going so fucking wrong. I know i sound overdramatic but the emotional pain i feel. Its too much. We cant even go to school yet. This is the same man who let me sleep on his lap and was holding me. I have so many fucking traumas. I turned to God and i dont know why but i feel so far away from him again. I overthink everything. I need help. Im getting suicidal thoughts. Im thinking of harming myself but i love myself and ive been through so much and am still going through so much. I feel so alone AGAIN. I dont even have my own room no privacy yet because the fucking basement is still getting renovated. I swear somebody is fucking praying on my downfall because everything is going so wrong and i dont know if it will get better. I dont know how to cope. I dont know. I need help. Please. I have feelings too. Im a human too. I have a pure heart. I just want to love and be loved. Is that so wrong? Is that too much to ask? Everything is so fucking overwhelming. Im a good person. I show love and i care but why is everyone so mean to me? You have no idea how hard it is. One mean joke. ONE SMALL LITTLE JOKE is enough to keep me up crying at night. Its too much. Why is it me? why is it always me?",

The last 5 years he has had 4 quite serious episodes. 2 of them with suicidal thoughts, and the latest one with a failed suicide attempt. \n\nUp until after the last attempt, he has denied all professional help. But it seems like this time he is going to accept it. We are lucky to be living in a country with free healthcare. I think after the episodes, I’ve always been very good at being there for him. However this fades a bit when I go back to normal life, as we live in different cities, and he can be quite tough to get in touch with on the phone. \n\nOne of the things he hates the most, are people treating him differently because of the depression. I think I am very good at treating him normally, because I am one of few he wants to spend time with after a serious episode. \n\nI really want to support him in his process of getting better. I have never felt the way that he is feeling now, so I don’t fully know how to do things. He doesn’t want to talk about his feelings with me, which is fine. I can’t force him. What I hopefully can do, is to make him feel better sometimes. Maybe give him hope. \n\nSo I was wondering if there are anyone that has been in the same situation as him, that could help me with what to do or say to make his day a little bit easier? What meant the world to you when you were depressed?\n\nAlso when it comes to work, how much better should he get before work is an option? His last jobs has taken a huge toll on him. And he isn’t the type that gives up. So he’s gotten very far down because he keeps on working until he mentally can’t anymore. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I don't even know where to begin. I'm writing this because my mental health is in the gutter and I need to just put it all out there. Maybe someone can make sense of it, because I can't.\n\nI was born in April 2006 in Lansing, Michigan. I'm a guy. Ever since I was young, I have always been into girls. Like, when I was in elementary school I used to, oh god... this is embarrassing... I would pretend I dropped something like a pencil or an eraser look under the table I was sat at to see under the girls' skirts in my class. I know, it's disgusting.\n\nI grew up and had a good childhood. I was a chubby kid back then. Now, when I started highschool, I used to have no discipline and no sense of hygiene. I didn't take showers— only sometimes - like once a week or once every two weeks.\n\nI woke up, went to school, and didn't use the toilets in school since I hated them and thought they were disgusting. I held my pee in until I got home. I also held my poop in, which is what caused my body to always be warm and that's what caused my skin to go bad and made it fill with pimples. My parents warned me not to pop any pimples as they can cause permanent scarring and damage, but I was an idiot and around 11 or 12 years old back then so I ignored them and thought they were just making a bunch of stuff up.\n\nMy usual routine was: wake up, eat breakfast, go to school, don't pay attention in class (since I was too \"cool\" for it), eat lunch during lunchtime, come home and play on my PlayStation 4 for long hours or use my iPad to play games, etc. Yes, I was spoiled. Also, I was the first child, the oldest one in the house with one younger brother. I was living the dream.\n\nI always used to hold in my poop, which is very dangerous, since I didn't wanna waste my time on the toilet. Sometimes I couldn't hold it so I had to use the toilet, like when I was excited about something or if I ate too much. It's already pretty bad, I know, but things are about to go haywire so... yeah.\n\nIt was here where I started to watch \"spicy\" content. It wasn't porn; I didn't fully discover it. I started to watch these kissing prank videos, nude celebrities, etc. Then I got caught by my parents, which was embarrassing.\n\nI was also very, VERY horny at this stage of my life. During this time I was also bullied quite a lot. I was always the tallest in my grade. I started to develop a little mustache (little). I was a pretty chubby kid and got bullied and got called \"fat shit\" in school. Girls made fun of me, basically everyone did.\n\nSo my dad decided to put me on the treadmill so I lose weight because this extra weight wasn't good for my health and plus he didn't want to see his son be lazy everyday. He pushed me every day until in a month's time I could jog at a pace of 8km/h for 40 minutes. I started to lose weight during this period and could eat almost anything since I was still growing and had a pretty fast metabolism and was always hungry and felt really hot (fast metabolism). It was amazing; and I was starting to get in shape.\n\nBut that's when things took a turn. I was so horny. I was watching kissing pranks and I didn't realize they were fake. I took some pointers from those videos and went up to actual women... God, this is... I have no words to describe this abomination of an act.\n\nI talked to them seductively and had a boner in front of them. I saw this woman walking into the park and followed her and talked to her. She was very kind so I thought kindness would mean I could touch her, so I touched her boob. She quickly threw my hand away and said \"No,\" and I still kept on doing it. She said she'll report me to the police. The next day that same lady comes and visits my house, with her husband and told my parents everything.\n\nMy parents were devastated. Their face went pale. My heart was pounding a million times per second. I had this bad feeling or sensation wash up on me. Her husband threatened my parents, said they'll report this to the police, and was very pissed.\n\nMy father, a high moral and intelligent, high honour good man who never had to apologize or beg someone like this before, begged him not to report me to the police. He went down to his knees and put his head on his shoes and cried (I know this because my mom told me after all this). I was sitting in my room listening. My dad was very pissed and angry and disappointed. He had so many emotions; he couldn't believe his son could do this. He warned me not to do it again.\n\nNow keep in mind, I'm dumb—like stone-age level dumb. Like, really dumb, even though nothing is wrong with my brain. So during this time, watching porn etc., I was looking at women's vaginas and wondering where the penis is. I thought women had penises. I was 12, mind you. I was looking for videos of women with penises. I didn't even learn that women have anuses too until I was 15. See, I didn't focus in school, didn't understand English very well, had limited knowledge and nothing about maths or science. I was basically a fuck-up.\n\nNow in my family there is this no-privacy rule where our room (me and my brother slept in the same room) had to have the door open always. So I had not a lot of time to watch porn. I had wet dreams during these periods and wondered why my pants suddenly get filled up with this sticky white liquid when I wake up (cum), or why I eject this white liquid when I watch porn. I thought there was something wrong with me or why I have a boner. I didn't know what these were; I was new to this. I genuinely thought there is something wrong with me. We don't usually have sex talk in my family; they don't talk about these things openly.\n\nDuring this time, age 12-13 (which most of the things that happened are around), I had so many school crushes on girls. I lusted over them heavily but didn't dare touch them or anything because I knew they would complain to the headmaster's office and parents will be involved, etc.\n\nBut it was summer a few months later and I looked at them in a lustful and creepy way. They were my age, all in my class. I looked at their butts and got super horny. It was sports day and I looked at their boobs; they were slim fit and had good body. So I looked at these two sisters who wore tight leggings or tights and I could see their butt and kept looking when no one was seeing and fantasized having sex with them. They had a ponytail and were beautiful.\n\nBut then even worse happens. I did the same act again and started to call on girls and be like \"hey baby nice tits or sexy ass wanna fuck\" etc., like some disgusting rapist shit, and looked them lustfully up and down and they could see it. I started harassing girls, following them, and some even said they'll report me.\n\nSo one day, from afar from a window, I started following a girl and looked from the window to see where she was going. And that's when my dad caught me. He took me home and hit me multiple times with a belt and was very angry with me. I wet my pants cause of the beating (which was well deserved; he should have broken my face).\n\nNow the reason for this extreme horniness is because I didn't know how to jerk off or masturbate. Kids this age know, but not Mr. Dumbo here (me).\n\nSo after this fucked up situation, my dad banned me for 3 months from video games, iPad, or any screen, etc. He also shaved my head during this time since it was summer (and my brother's head too, but my younger brother could adapt. He was also punished for my actions—collective punishment, I guess).\n\nI would play chess, study, or do maths, go outside, bring groceries, etc.\n\nAnd also remember that ever since I was a child, like 6 or 8 years old, my mum used to hit me sometimes when she made me study and I got things wrong. Since my dumb brain couldn't comprehend maths or couldn't concentrate or learn my times tables, etc., she used to hit me with hangers or rulers (the bendy ones that could bend that hurt, but not like full force, just punishment). I also have a grandpa and dad who would criticize or scold me sometimes if I made some mistakes. The men did that.\n\nI had a friend who would come to my house sometimes and he was kind of like my best friend in elementary school until I left. When I went to high school I had no friends; I was a loner. I wanted to be friends with someone but they weren't really my friends. There were these two guys: top of the class and heavy into video games, etc. I asked them for some math advice and walked with them to the school library or canteen during lunch break. I used to play video games with them; they added me to PSN (PlayStation Network) and we played online.\n\nBut yeah, my dad said since I was banned forever until I improved my grades, he'll unban me from everything until I improve. So I did. I worked very, very hard to understand math (my weakness; I was like a grade 3 person in grade 8 when it came to maths, and everything else).\n\nSo I watched basics all of them for maths: what are numbers, how to add and subtract and multiply and divide and work with fractions, decimals, PEMDAS (I didn't even know division properly), then times tables. I worked very hard and started to stay late after school (a thing I never did since I thought only nerds do this, since I'm not a nerd). I stayed late after school and asked teachers about my maths misconceptions and any help they could give. It paid off and I started getting 60% in my exams—a huge jump from 7-10%. I also worked hard in physics class and paid attention and got 80% marks too.\n\nAnd my dad also told me to read at least for one hour a day a book, whether it's a fiction or non-fiction. So I started reading Harry Potter, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, etc., and improved my English a lot. I used my phone dictionary (I also had a phone; my mum's iPhone 5 was given down to me) and it had parental lock and everything so I could not surf the web or watch YouTube, only dictionary access. So I looked up words and what they meant and worked very hard. My English reading grade went from a level of a 9-year-old to a level of a 12.5-year-old in a span of 3 months. I was 13 then.\n\nSo they called my dad and told him this. He was very happy and took unbanned me so I could watch TV, use my laptop (he gave me a laptop for personal use and for school). He said there is gonna be a limit to video games. Like before, when I played video games whenever or however much I could, this time it was only for Fridays (when I come home from school), Saturdays and Sundays for 2 hours each day. And he also said he expects me to do my homework and not delay it or miss any deadlines. So I was always punctual to school, never missed homework, and mostly did my homework during lunch in the school library. If there was more, I finished it at home in under an hour. I was a good kid back then.\n\nNow my dad and my grandpa make me do things like bring them a glass of water or help them with something, etc., like normal things. But they also heavily criticized me and called me dumb and sometimes make fun of my brain.\n\nFor example, my grandpa will ask, \"Hey, tighten this screw here,\" or \"bring me something from the toolbox.\" It was either I couldn't tighten the screw or find the thing he wants from the toolbox. Simple things like that resulted in me getting scolded when the item, for example, I was looking for was in the toolbox.\n\nAnother example: I accidentally opened the door without looking when there was a person walking on the side and hit him. My dad had to apologize to the person (he is a very kind and peaceful guy) but then he angrily looked at me and cursed at me, \"son of a bitch, you didn't see him coming!\" Sometimes it results in a mild slap (not too hard).\n\nHe cares deeply about respect and honour and doesn't take lightly when someone disrespects the family name, the religion, the country, the race, etc. He says to me and my brother we represent all these things. My dad is a short-tempered guy but a good guy nonetheless.\n\nNow fast forward. I completed high school and got decent grades. But now I'm 18 and I am free. I'm looking for a job and got a local job. Now I'm thinking about sex and love and girls and women, etc.\n\nI was heavy on porn and by then I had already realized women don't have penises but vaginas. In these porn videos I saw a \"happy ending\" massage being given to a guy by an Asian woman. So I decided to check Asian parlours near me that offer nuru massage or happy ending. I found one on Google Maps with good reviews (which don't mention any sexual experiences) and visited it one day. I said \"happy ending.\"\n\nThere was this beautiful mid-30 or late early 40-year-old looking woman and she was hot. It was an experience like nothing I ever felt. I never kissed anyone well; I did that day. I never felt that women would be attracted to me and this was first time I was seeing someone attracted to me. Then after this day I tried to learn how to masturbate so I'm not horny any more so finally I discovered masturbation at age 18 (how dumb can you get to discover something that a 14 yr old or a 12 yr old should be discovering).\n\nI then regretted everything I did and felt guilty as heck. But I never got any attention from girls. After some time, she wasn't there and left the massage parlour so didn't work anymore. I used to go every 2 months to visit the massage parlour. I wanted affection. I wanted to be loved, to be cared for, and I wanted to be lusted over since I never experienced that before. That's why I never forgot this experience.\n\nBut then after some time I started to get addicted. I saw other masseuses; all were Chinese masseuses since it was an oriental massage parlour. Eventually, I wished I didn't. I had sex after 1 year of visiting it for the first time. Then after 3-4 months I had sex with escorts.\n\nI was devastated, empty, soulless that I could do such a thing. I was also masturbating this time but I tried to restrain myself but couldn't. I wanted a physical person, a body I could touch and interact with who would willingly kiss me and have sex with me. So I kept visiting and drained my own money.\n\nI can never fully recover from this. I regret this deeply and have so, so, so much guilt. I wish I didn't do this; this is not me. I wish I had found a good girl and made her my gf like everyone else does.\n\nAlso during this time I was learning to drive and still haven't because you might say the problem is instructors or the teachers, but the whole problem is me. I had 4 instructors and still failed my driving test. On top of that, I had 60 hours of driving lessons. People pass in 30; by now I probably have 65 hours and I'm still not ready for driving. That's how dumb I am.\n\nThe only thing I'm good at is running, which I can improve on and be better than most people since I'm above average.\n\nI wish I had friends to guide me, a gf, and some help. I'm alone. My parents are just parents, not friends. I love them but they're not like friends; you don't share everything with parents.\n\nI disappointed my family. I disappointed myself and the world. My dad once said \"You're a burden to this world.\" I hate my life. I feel depressed.\n\nI can't get a gf now. I'm done because I don't like to lie. I would probably tell her all about me so she knows who she's getting into because maybe she thought of me as someone else, but then the truth would probably hurt so better to let her know beforehand.\n\nAlso, I'm not a bad person internally. I wanna help people. I wanna give charity and probably create my own organization in the medical sector helping people for free, etc.\n\nThere's way more to the story but I'm so tired of this. I'll write the entire second part later, but here's a summary of my life: I have no job, I'm not tall, average or slightly above average looking, average or slightly below average dick, not rich—I'm broke. I want help. Am I a bad person? I disappointed my parents a lot.\n\nI don't understand things. Like the other day my dad told me to build this simple, super simple DIY science kit for 7+ ages that he ordered from Temu and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. I tried fixing a DualShock 4 controller, a PS4 controller, but couldn't. I'm a loser. I need help. I need advice.\n\nI don't feel that guilty or disappointed in myself as I'm writing; I feel nothing. I feel empty, soulless. But some days when I think about or reflect on what I did in my life, I wish I had died and never been such an asshole. My mental health isn't even strong right now.\n\nI'm working hard right now and trying my best to improve myself, learn new skills, become a better person etc. But I feel lonely. I don't wanna die alone - that's one of my greatest fear. But I guess after all I did, I deserve to die alone with no family, no kids, no one to take care of me and a fuck-up in the end.\n\nI also fell in love with a K-pop idol. And before you say it's lust, it's not. I rarely fall in love but when I do I fall hard. I fell in love with this idol because she's so kind, nice, and beautiful. My type is someone who looks like they came from the skies like an angel (like a Greek goddess). She's half-Korean, half-white Australian and she looks so beautiful. I wasn't initially attracted to her when I first saw her, but as she did more Insta lives and she smiles and talks so kindly and is so nice, and she shares so many similar traits to me (not those I listed, not those asshole traits)—like her favourite color is the same as mine, her favourite movie same as mine, her personality is happy and jumping and sunshine and very uplifting, etc.\n\nI want her, yet I know I don't deserve her. I am also starting to see my hair balding (not yet but I can see signs). I'm done for. No girl will like me. I feel like killing myself but I can't. Then sometimes I don't wanna die and feel like it's my duty to educate people and help people like me never make the same mistakes I did. I'm a lost cause, I'm empty, I'm soulless...\n\nI'm a...disappointment.",

    "selftext": "I’m writing this post because I don’t want to burden friends and family members with it.\n\nI am a male in my mid 40s, married in a loving relationship with someone who is not high drama or high maintenance (previously I have been in bad relationships, so I know the difference), beautiful school age children, cute dogs at home, and make what would be considered a high income in a relatively low stress job and at the same time is something that is “meaningful/rewarding”, and the people I work with are generally non malignant and there are no significant work stresses.  I exercise sometimes frantically to get away from depression.  So I have no excuses.  And at the same time I believe there are never really “reasons” for depression.  Rather, what I have come to learn is that it is the opposite. \n\nI have suffered from depression since my early twenties.  I’m in the medical field (without getting specific) and know the clinical signs of this disease, and realized during my training that a period of a few months of high anxiety, low mood, waking up at 3 in the morning and unable to fall back to sleep, suicidality and generally having no enjoyment in any activity — all this was a major depressive episode.  I had several on and off and went on and off medication (it took a while to find the “right thing”) until in my early 30s I had a very very severe episode lasting about a year, along with severe derealization symptoms, where I was hanging on to functional existence by my fingernails and I went back in my medications and have stayed on them since religiously out of fear.  \n\nThese medications have saved my life and allowed me to get where I am, and in fact for a nearly 10 year period I would even say that I was “happy”.  The ceaseless passive suicidal ideation even went away, and when I had those thoughts they had no “emotional resonance”.  Of course, I also have a sort of narrower emotional range which comes with these medications and accepted it as part of what I had to sacrifice.  People who know me look at me as being “steady” and “no drama” but it’s because I have the equivalent of lidocaine in my brain.  And I am (was) fine with that.\n\nHowever, since perhaps the COVID pandemic and after, my depression has come back in the sense that while the medication still prevents me from becoming totally dysfunctional, inside I have basically restarted relentless suicidal thoughts (my first thought/feeling on waking up in the morning is the desire to hang myself) and have the typical zero interest in all things.  I do the things, I come home, and eventually go to bed and repeat.  I love my children and family and wife and it almost feels bittersweet because I know that, especially over the past year, I make the outside expressions of having fun with them but on the inside I can barely feel a thing except deep despair.  \n\nI know I will never act on any suicidal thoughts because of what it will do to my children and wife and family.  But at the same time, I feel like my life has already ended.  Inside, I am already dead.  I look at recent vacation pictures and compared to years past it looks clearly as though something has been extinguished in me.  My wife is aware of my history and somewhat how I currently feel but it’s very hard to convey to a non depressed person the extent of the relentlessness of depression.  \n\nIn some senses it’s as though I should have ended it years ago and I am holding on to a cliff face, basically being alive when I am actually “past due” for existence.  In another sense, “spiritually” I have already committed suicide.  I guess what I wonder is how one continues day to day when you have this sense that you are already gone, and how you protect your family from living with a sort of zombie or shell of a person.  \n\nI also know this could just be “poop out” of my meds…but I am too exhausted to try something new for it.

But it's not just that I try and do the right thing and reach out to friends who say things like \"My door is always open\" or \"Come to me when you feel this way.\" I try not to be annoying and constantly go to them crying so I try to figure it out myself until i can't but when I do reach out it feels like everytime I go and open \"the door\" the door is locked or I'll let them know \"Hey I'm having a really bad/hard time and just need someone to talk too\" I'm met with \"I'm sorry I have plans/ I'm sorry I'm busy\",\" you're stuck in your head you just need a better mind set\" or \"just don't do anything stupid.\" I try not to complain and tell them I understand. I'm not entitled to their time so I try not to get upset about it. But I always end up alone in my room crying to myself. I feel empty and that I'm just wasting time until I can end it I even have a date that I always tell myself this year is going to be the year. I don't know this year feels different this is the first time I have written suicide letters. I have them all set for my friends and family I'm just getting everything ready so I don't leave to much of a mess behind. I can't keep going I feel like my body is constantly in pain I feel like I need to throw up all the time and I can barely eat without feeling sick. Everybody thinks i'm losing weight because i'm getting better but in reality, i'm losing weight because I can't eat. I look in the mirror and i don't even see light in my eyes anymore. I'm just so tried and I feel like I'm wasting space. I don't want to keep going I don't want the sad pity looks and sympathy that people give me once they know I'm feeling this way. I just want to let go and sleep forever. I'm not strong enough anymore I feel like a timer is running out and death is waiting for me. So maybe this year is the year maybe I can finally stop being scared and just let go.",

    "selftext": "please help im struggling a lot\n\ni have been best friends with, lets call T(22M), for almost 6 years. T struggles with depression and had a tough upbringing. I have also had my share of mental illness so I understand some of his thoughts and try my best to help, but i still struggle to help him in some ways. \n\nI often find myself upset with T. He sometimes messages me things like “should we even continue this friendship?” “whats the point of staying connected to me” etc. He feels that killing himself is his only possibility/out come. He says “why stay attached to me when you can leave early and not get hurt when I finally kill myself”. I tell him, well I dont want that happening at all so why would I leave my best friend? He brings up similar convos and it just leaves me feeling defeated. No matter what I say, he always ends it with, “well im just going to kill myself”.\n\nI have tried many many many times to get him to get professional help, but he either says he just doesn’t care to get better, or he says, “they’re just going to give me meds and i’m probably going to OD on them”. Like what am I supposed to do at that point?\n\nLast week after a very blunt message from me cause I was feeling very upset (I dont know if it was the best to send, but I didn’t know what else to do), he said fine, he will give it one year to get better. After a whole conversation of me saying you can’t put a time limit on things etc, he said, thats in a year, years a long time and it would help for you to say to me during hard times, “it hasn’t been a year yet”. I eventually gave up since we were just going in circles, and said fine. If thats what would help you in the moment, I will say that. But now im scared that will just continue to enforce the thought of him needing to kill himself once a year passes. Anyways, despite him saying he would try this year, he doesn’t actually want to start anything. I have given him things to start with that I have learned in my own therapy sessions for myself, such as start with small goals like doing self care everyday/few days a week consistently. He just ends up back at, “I just don’t care to do that”. I told him nothing is going to change this year if you don’t put in the effort, you can’t just wait until you “feel like it”, you have to make that choice yourself. He dismisses me. I feel like we’re broken records, I say the same things every time, and so does he. \n\nThis is probably selfish of me, but I care very much for him and he’s basically my only friend at this point so ofc I don’t want to distance myself. But it’s hard when my friend is so adamant on killing themselves. And I can’t just leave because he has also once said if i left, he’d just kill himself sooner since thats one less person to care about him. \n\nAnd when I tell him how it makes ME feel as his best friend when he says/acts this way, he just says, well then its easier I just ill myself so you don’t have to deal with me.\n\nI just feel so frustrated and lost, I dont know what to do.

    "title": "I (16M) almost took my life yesterday. But I didnt and instead of feeling better, I feel even worse.",
    "selftext": "Before I start, I am sorry, I really am if this whole post is all over the place. My mind isnt in the right place right now. I have tried my best to put my thoughts in a orderly manner, but I am sorry if it is difficult to read  \n  \nOk so I have had my fair share of suicidal thoughts since many years. There are like a million reasons for it. And I cant ever list them all, so I will just give a summary of them.  \n  \nI was born in a joint family, which means about 5 whole families live in one house. Which in turn means, I have spent all my 16 years living in one room alongside my family. YES MY FAMILY OF 5 LIVES IN ONE ROOM. YES ONE ROOM. ONE BED. ONE WASHROOM. I cant emphasize on how bad it is. No privacy. No nothing. These two things already create way too many problems for me. I mean the other 4 families for some reason hate my family, especially my mom, so there is way too much tension in the house. There are constant fights and arguments and bickering and what not between our family and the other 4. Simply put, they want us to leave the house and are trying everything in their power to do so. However, for some reason my parents are some of the most stubborn and indecisive people on this planet. They also hate the other 4 families but for some reason, they havent left the house. They want to, but they havent. I KNOW THEY CAN AFFORD IT. But it is their indecisiveness, that has trapped me in this hellhole for 16 years.  \n  \nHowever, all of this would have been acceptable if my own family didnt hate each other. Yes, even in my own family of 5, there is simply no unity. And it is all because of my mother. I know it may seem like I am exaggerating because I am some immature teenager who is just really mad, but I am not when I say that my mother is the single most worst mother ever and is also the person I hate the most in my life. She has singlehandedly ruined my life, my siblings’ life and my father’s life. How? Well she is a seriously mentally ill person. If I were living in the US or any other western country with basic awareness about mental health, she would have been locked up in an asylum. She has way too many mental issues for me list here, but I will try to explain a few. Since, she has had fights with the other 4 families, she always takes out that anger on her own family. That may not seem bad, but that anger isnt just any anger. IT IS CONSTANT 24/7 SCREAMING, NAGGING, CURSING AND PHYSICAL ABUSE. And I dont mean “fuck you” type of cursing. I mean very sincere and honest curses like “I wish you get married to a person who does this and this to you”, “I hope you are never able to sleep ever again and go mentally insane, “I wish you die”, “I wish I never gave birth to you”, “I hope you fail all your exams” and much more worse and personal curses. There is constant screaming and swearing from her side only. In fact, it is because of her that I have developed this habit of speaking slightly more loudly than most people. But this is not the end. She is a manipulative person as well. Whenever, she does all of this and if we ever get upset from her, she makes it all about her. She rants about how her life is the worst, and how we shouldnt be upset, and instead be praising her. SHE WANTS US TO PRAISE HER FOR MAKING OUR LIVES A MISERY. She also doesnt accept that she has mental issues. Instead she has recently developed this idea that everyone except her is mentally ill. She calls us all mentally ill people. And she also has this “main character syndrome”. She thinks the whole world revolves around her. She thinks and expresses that we and everyone other person in the world, (she literally once accused a random maid of our neighbours of secret plotting to disturb her sleep) hates her and is working against her. ALSO I TOTALLY FORGOT TO MENTION, BUT WHEN MY BROTHER WAS BORN, SHE TRIED TO KILL HIM LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES, AND I AND MY SISTER HAD TO STOP HER. And I know, this doesnt seem like a big deal at all. Because I havent explained even 1% of the whole picture. Just for y’all to get a good idea, I am fairly mature because of all this trauma, so trust me when I say she is the worst person I have ever met, she really is.  \n  \nThese 2 are probably the main reasons for why I have had some suicidal thoughts. I have seriously thought about ending it all but have never acted on it. I used to wonder why I had to live such a life and all the usual self hatred stuff. But eventually, I grew numb to it all. Both the joint family problems and my mother are still the same. No, infact, in the past 2 years, my mother has gotten more mentally ill and more violent. She has ran away many times by now. But simply put, I dont care anymore. I have accepted it. Besides, my life isn't all bad. In fact, apart from these 2 things (which are like pretty big but still), my life is really good. I am really grateful for my life.  \n  \nMy father is the single most best person I have ever met. And once again I am not exaggerating. He is literally a saint. His patience and his ability to live with a person like my mother probably puts him alongside the best people to have ever lived on this planet. He literally picks up random people he finds walking on the road and drops them to their destination everyday. He donates to every single guard he encounters as a way to thank them for the security they provide. He does so many more good deeds. He is also the most loving and supporting person ever. YES HE IS THAT GOOD. I could write an entire book about how good he is and it wont be enough.  \n  \nMy siblings are also really loving. Obviously, my sister and I have our usual and completely normal fights, but we have gotten really close because of our shared hatred for our mother. However, it is my brother who I love the most in the whole world. It is probably because I also pity him for what he had to go through as a child. Since birth, he saw that his mom hated him and wanted to kill him. Because of this, he also has a few problems, not too severe but like anger issues and serious mood swings. ANYWAYS I LOVE HIM WAY TOO MUCH. **And this is the reason, why he used to be the sole reason (I said “used” because now I have another reason which I will discuss later on), I didnt want to commit suicide.** I knew if I did it, he would be left traumatised forever. He has already suffered way too much because of my mother. I dont want to add to his misery which he doesnt deserve. If anything, I want to take his share of misery for myself. Also, I just wanted to see him grow up. So yeah, over the years, he was the only reason I didnt commit suicide despite living such a life. Before my brother had been born, I had told myself I wouldnt commit suicide because it was against my religion and I would banished to hell forever. Luckily, it was after he was born that I found out that my religion doesnt necessarily have any ruling about suiciding. So yeah glad, I discovered it after I found another reason otherwise things might have gone really wrong.\n\n  \n\n\nI am also grateful to have many friends in general, so I dont suffer from loneliness. I have 2 of the most sincere friends. One of them is like the nicest person ever. He is probably the second kindest, nicest and best person I have ever met and probably will (or maybe he is in the 1st position alongside my father). Not to brag or anything, I have had really good grades through out my life. I have always gotten 1st position and highest percentage (or grades) in my school. I am really popular in school, like I was the headboy and all that stuff many times. I am telling of this to let y’all know that my school life was also really good.\n\n  \n\n\nIn terms of my love life, I really didnt have any till very recently because I go to a boys only school. But a few months ago, I reconnected with my childhood crush. We have gotten pretty close since then. I have developed feelings for her again. AND LET ME TELL YOU SHE IS THE PERFECT GIRL. She is the most pretty, gorgeous and beautiful (If I write 100 more synonyms, it wont be enough) girl I have ever seen (not met, seen). Even popular women like Ana de Armas and Sydney Sweeney seem unattractive me when compared to her. She is also really nice, friendly, helpful, kind, religious, supportive, funny, chill, casual and simply put, the perfect girl anyone can want or even dream of. AND I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE GOTTEN REALLY CLOSE TO HER OVER THESE MONTHS. She does give me mixed signals. I cant really figure out if she likes me or not. **However, she has become my 2nd reason for not wanting to commit suicide.** I really like her a lot. I want to get into a relationship with her (we are already in a situationship). I want to marry her (ik this is immature, but I am just getting things off my chest). And for this reason, I dont wanna end it all. I wanna see where this goes.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, you must be wondering, why in the world would I want to end my life, when I just explained how good it is. Well, a bunch of events built up to it. Because of my summer vacations, my sleep schedule was really messed up. I used to sleep after sunrise and wake up in the evening. However, since my classes have started, this has gotten really bad because I still sleep very late but I have to wake up early. Then last week, my father took my mother to a therapist. And since that day, she has just gotten way worse (because as I said, she doesnt think she is mentally ill and got mad at my father for taking her there). Since that day, she has attempted to run away and abandon us like 10 times. So this was already stressing me out. Yesterday, in school a bunch of tests were taken, and for the first time, I didnt do good in one. I didnt mind it too much, but it was still something that built up to it. However, perhaps the most major event happened on my crush’s birthday which was also yesterday. I wished her the happiest birthday and we had a really fun convo. However, when I posted a story on Instagram for her birthday, she asked to take it down. She said she doesnt talk to any guys other than me and that is why she didnt want other guys (who were following me) to see that story. She said she didnt want any rumors about us. I was completely fine will all of this. I immediately took it down. I apologized to her but she didnt accept the apology saying she should be the one apologizing for being like this and she should be thanking me for being this understanding. My point is, our conversation ended on a good note. We didnt have any fight or anything like that. However, I for some reason, started overthinking. I thought that maybe she didnt want any rumors about me and her, and that she would have been fine if I was somebody else. I thought that she just didnt want be to be associated with her. I thought she didnt want her friends knowing she was talking to someone like me (because the story I would posting, would have to be reposted by her since that is what everyone does). I just thought about this. I didnt believe in it. I knew I was just overthinking. So, to get things off my chest, that day I talked to my sister about it. She also confirmed that I was just overthinking and all. We talked about it for so long that I didnt get the time to sleep after school. Since, I only get about 3 hours of sleep nowadays, I sleep after I come home from school. However, yesterday I couldnt because I talked way too much with my sister. By 8pm or 9pm, we were done talking, but I knew if I slept then, I would randomly wake up very late at night (like around 3am or 4am) and it would mess up my sleep schedule even more, so I just decided that I would try to stay awake till like 11pm and then just sleep. However, at around 10pm my brother and sister asked me to get them some French fries and burgers because our parents werent home (apparently, my dad had taken my mother somewhere to make up to her for taking her to a therapist) and there was nothing else to eat. By then, I felt like my brain was going to explode. It felt like eyes were bleeding. Simply put, I was not having a good time. But I also couldnt say no to my siblings, because then I would be no different from my mother as I would be taking my anger on them for no reason. So despite not feeling well (and yeah I forgot to mention, I had fever as well), I went out and walked to the nearest restaurant (because the car was with my parents). I got them their food. And finally, at around 11pm, I laid on my couch (I dont a separate bed, but I recently got my own couch, so yayyy) in hopes of finally being to sleep. GUESS WHAT? My parents came back. They opened all the lights of the room. They started having dinner and started talking when I was trying to sleep. And as if that wasnt already bad, my mother told me to get milk because we had ran out of it. I told her I was really tired and I couldnt. She then started nagging about how much useless, I am and how I never do anything. I tried to explain to her that I had just went outside, but she wouldnt listen. I also didnt have the energy to argue with her, so I decided to go. But then for the first time ever, I firmly and completely decided that instead of going to get milk, I would go outside, and get run over by some car. I was tired the shit out of my mind. I just wanted to end it all. I was literally only like 5 steps away from the nearest road. Finally, I got into my senses. I realized I was overreacting. I bought the milk. I went home. The lights were still on. There was still a lot of noise. But I let it be.  \n  \nHowever now I feel like an asshole. I feel like the worst person ever. I WAS LITERALLY ABOUT TO END IT ALL, WHY? BECAUSE I WAS TIRED? I feel immature. I feel stupid. I feel dumb. I feel bad. I also feel like the worst brother ever because I didnt think about how me ending my life would affect my brother. I also feel like I am not capable or worthy of being with my crush. SHE IS THE MOST PERFECT GIRL. But all I am is a mentally ill and fucking broken asshole. I dont deserve her. And she doesnt deserve a loser like me who almost ended it all. She has her fair share of mental health problems but the thing is, she feels comfortable in sharing them with me. She tells me when she has such thoughts. She tells me when she cries. She tells me when she is tired. BUT I? I am just an insecure bitch who feels like she will judge me. I didnt tell her this. And I know I wont anytime soon. I just feel more awful. I feel like a complete loser. I dont even think my life is worthy of ending it. I just feel weird. And I dont know what to do about it",

Im 27 years old, in India, there are no unemployment support here for audhd. If i didnt have a brother who is willing to keep me alive by telling me not to work, i would've ended it by now. \n\nI am in a trap. I wanna choose to not exist if i have to work. But my brother tells me to simply not work and he would work and take care of us. I feel shitty because jobs are tough for him too and as i said, its not like i can't work, i just feel suicidal at the thought of having to. But i also feel shitty at the thought of being at his home not earning (i dont know if ill be happy or neutral or depressed still) while he goes out everyday to earn for the both of us, taking the struggles and stressors of life. I wish the guilt would push me enough to do a job but it just brings me back to suicidality. My brother tells me that he would be able to earn for the both of us, and he is completely fine with me doing nothing, as long as i keep living.\n\nSo many people must feel the same way but don't have the support system i have, especially when i very well could work but choose not to. \n\nI believe strongly in buddhism and rebirth and that jobs are a part of the dukkha of existence, about suicide being bad karma but i refuse to work towards healing myself, unless i have the certainty that i dont have to work.\n\nI'm stuck:( Anybody here who can relate or share their perspectives please.\n\n  \n",

I’m starting to spiral and I’m starting to feel like I’m going down the road of not wanting to be you know; alive. I don’t want to experience such  a horrible economy and everyday I’m reminded about how there’s now more unemployed people than job opportunities. I feel like I can’t even talk to my friends anymore and I just want to die. I gained 40 pounds too and just everything seems to be falling apart. My life has become studying and I don’t want to live.

I never had a school education growing up in the 90s and early 2000's.\nI have an education of that of a 2 yr old in every subject according to the ged papers.\n\nI been diagnosed with cptsd, severe chronic depression, paranoia, severe social anxiety.\n\nfirst gf I had i was 27, she dumped me at the local town fair for her ex. left me to walk back in a horrible storm in iowa 10 miles where I was renting a room. i moved from texas to iowa to be with her after a year online together skyping and talking for a year.  met her through a guild member in world of warcraft. \n\nsecond one was a few years later who faked her death on me, then would call me while doing it with someone, turned out she was married. \n\nI been single since, can't find anyone who would give me a chance. I don't care about sex anymore, its just the fact of wanting someone to be with, share things with, make memories with, someone who would love and support me, and have my back. \n\nI am on disability unable to work due to a horribly bad back and knees  riddled with arthritis from years of hard work on the farms. making working now very difficult, ontop of the cptsd and severe depression. \n\nI just am so lonely and so tired of being unwanted and not care for by anyone and always doing for others and never getting anything back in return. \n\nI am so lonely, i can't take this life anymore. i am just so tired of struggling day to day, no one to talk too, no one to get close too emotionally, mentally, to share things with, to watch things with, to play video games with and to just enjoy the night holding one another as we lay in the dark with candles lit and music playing. \n\njust so tired of not having that type of love and companionship in life. \n\nI am turning 45 soon and just so tired of spending it alone. just letting my health go unchecked hoping itll do me in soon. I have tried ending things several times before only to fail or chicken out because of fear of ending up brain dead. \n\nI just can't do it anymore. wish to god I was never born. only reason im even here is my mom wanted a child so bad, once i was born she didn't care anymore. as i got older her responsibilities towards me didn't matter even when I was  a young child. I was pawned off on others or just raising myself. \n\nI don't want this life anymore. I don't want to be alive anymore. \nits been 19 yrs and although my mom wasn't a good mom, I miss her horribly, and I miss my real dad as well, as the days go on and the nights get longer I miss them more and more and it gets harder and harder. \n\nI  just don't want this anymore, its not worth the pain and struggles and suffering of living life like this, alone, no family, no one in my life.",

But since I grew up to be “pretty,” it’s like people expect that to make everything okay, as if it erases my traumas.\n\nI feel like I’m a lost cause.\n\nI have three children who I love dearly, but I’m financially irresponsible and mentally unstable. They are my everything, but they deserve so much more. I’m trying my best to give it to them, but I feel like I’m failing. Sometimes I think they would be better off with their dad and his girlfriend—their “new mom.”\n\nI have a boyfriend who I love, but I’m afraid he’ll get tired of me—of my jealousy, of my insecurities about porn (which he stopped watching), of me comparing myself to his past “type” (goth, which I’m not). Even though he tells me he never wants me to change and that he wants me exactly as I am, I still feel like I’m not enough.\n\nOn top of that, I deal with PMDD, anxiety depression, and now a new autism diagnosis. He says he loves me, but I doubt myself. He’s my first real boyfriend, my first love, and I took his virginity when he was 25 and I was 26. I’m 28 now, and he’ll be 27 in December. He’s the absolute love of my life. I’ve never felt complete the way I do with him. We talk, we understand each other, we connect in ways I never thought possible—even though we’ve had some rough moments.\n\nWe’re both INFJs, both Christians. But I know he’s scared about being a stepdad, even though I’ve told him the responsibility isn’t on him. Still, after being with him for over a year, I fear he’s going to get tired of me or want sex from someone else eventually. My mind spins with so many thoughts I can’t control.\n\nPeople say, “It won’t always be this way.” But I’m 28, and it feels like it’s always going to be this way. When will it end? Where is my fairytale? When will I ever feel like I’m enough?\n\nI pray. I try. But I’m exhausted. I wish there were an easy way out. My thoughts keep getting stronger, and no one knows how close I am to ya kno. I’m 28, and it feels like the pain is only getting deeper.\n\nI don’t want to be here anymore. I want to run away. I live in a fairytale in my head where I give and give to everyone else, but I’m always last. I just want to be THAT girl. I want to be loved the way I love…\n",

But his wife is seeking a divorce, and he is seeing several pillars of life crumbling around him. Losing his family, hanging on to a job he hates, years of neglecting his own needs, a house that needs a lot of work, and the pressure to support kids with expensive hobbies. He is obviously in a major crisis. He's not getting out of bed, barely able to keep up work, not eating, etc. The alarming part is he has mentioned admitting himself to a psychiatric hospital, and even mentioned killing himself a couple times.\n\nSo between us, our mother and his wife, we are in contact every day. But I don't have magic words to talk him off the ledge. I know what hopeless depression looks like, I've been there.\n\nWe live in different states and he is leaning hard on me to give him a way out. I'm of course always here for him, but he is asking if he can move into my home and we can take care of each other, pool finances, etc. I've explained to him that I'm always here, I will support him and be his friend, and he can live with me for a month as a transition should he decide to move out here. But I've stopped short of agreeing to merge our lives together, pooling finances under one roof in some kind of marriage of two single aging siblings. But today he was especially desperate, repeating this request, slurring his speech, so I agreed just to keep him stable, if it makes him feel better right now. That would be a few years down the line anyway.\n\nMy concern is I am unable to satisfactorily calm him down or help him over the phone. I don't have magic words to reframe his hopeless thoughts. He is talking about committing himself to a psychiatric hospital, or giving up, and has mentioned taking his life a couple times a a possibility.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Across long distance? What should I do?  As a last resort intervention there is 911 but I don't want to call them ever, that is risky in a mental health situation. Has anyone called 988?",

Im exhausted of living like this but I dont want to let my family down because they will feel embarrassed that thier daughter killed herself and will simply blame it on being a teenager like they always do or the fact that I’m a girl! Because apparently if I’m a girl I’m more sensitive and take things to heart. ",

But when I leave for even a second that \"smile\" fades into nothing as if it didn't exist.

It took him two and half hours to get to me. I called at one point and asked him where he was, and he was 30 mins away at the point which meant he lied about leaving when he did. He had an attitude and was like I’m coming. At that point I just yelled at him and told him to turn around and go home. He told me he was done with me because of that.

    "selftext": "I'm 16 years old, and I had my first breakup this summer. We hadn't seen each other for two months because we were at the beach. She ended our 11-month relationship over text, with three messages, while at her friend's house, and two weeks before Carnival. We had a silly argument before that, where we didn't talk for a few days.  \n\nAnyway, I gave my all to our relationship. My family doesn't have much money, but I bought her a R$200 ring, only to throw it away two months later—after introducing her to my family, after changing the way I acted for her, after buying her a bouquet and a ring. I was faithful from start to finish; I never cheated on her. To me, she was perfect—she still is. She made me feel loved, and she gave me a sense of security, making me believe she would always be there for me. I thought she would be the mother of my children, that we would get married and build a beautiful life together, just as I had asked God for. She always seemed like a good person from beginning to end. She also made childish mistakes—no one is perfect. We argued sometimes when we didn't see each other, since we only met on Wednesdays and weekends, but arguments are normal in a relationship.  \n\nThe reasons she gave me for the breakup were that we \"argued too much,\" even though we only fought when we weren’t together. And yet, she still said I was amazing. We had planned to see each other since we had English classes on Wednesdays, so we could have met up and talked about the breakup. But I decided not to talk and switched my class from Wednesday to Friday. I was sure I would cry too much if I saw her on Wednesday, so I wanted to wait until I felt better mentally. Months later, I switched back to Wednesday—to face my fear of seeing her and because I liked the people in the Wednesday class.  \n\nI sent her a message explaining everything I was going through and my opinion on what happened. On the day of the breakup, she had asked me not to hate her. In my message, I reassured her that she didn’t need to worry—I wouldn’t hate her. I also told her she didn’t need to reply because she had already said what she wanted to say. But deep down, I still hoped for a response. In the end, I wished her all the best, and she just read the message and didn’t reply.  \n\nThese past two months after the breakup have been horrible. Two days before she ended things, I had told her I was going on a trip and had an opportunity in football. Even knowing that, she still decided to break up with me. Now I’m here, on this trip, desperate to go back home. In a few days, I’ll be back.  \n\nDuring the first month, I cried A LOT every single day and couldn't sleep, so I started sleeping with my parents. I developed a gym addiction—I was already working out before, but now I’m fully committed. I’ve been eating a lot more, but only healthy food, and drinking lots of water. But my self-esteem is still awful, and my thoughts of ending my life and stopping this pain grow stronger every day. I see no hope in my life. I just want to throw up all my organs and stop feeling anything.  \n\nI compare myself to everyone around me now: \"If I were more handsome, would she have left me? If I had a different face, hair, or body, would she have broken up with me?\" I have no will to live anymore. I’m not the same person I used to be. It might sound dramatic, but something inside me has changed. The world has lost its colors for me. I don’t think I’ll ever find someone who will truly value me and fill this emptiness.  \n\nI don’t want to start dating random people to try to fill this void in my chest, and I don’t want to use people just because I feel lonely. I also don’t want to become a bad person just because someone hurt me. But I can’t take this anymore. Like I said, I don’t know if life is worth living. I can’t stop thinking about her.

I've  tried most conventional methods of getting therapy and even trying antidepressants, which didn't help me mentally, physically or anything in between. I do not feel like my family understands me let alone do they try to, nor do I have  any true friends that I feel like I can open up to without them judging me, or potentially blowing it off due to the fact that they all have their own issues (which might I add, is fair as I don't want to hold them back either).  Even if I wanted to try talking to many of the amazing people that are here or either the chats that I'm in over on discord, I am too much or a nervous wreck to do so, and additionally I haven't kept up with any of my friends either new or old due to the fact that I prefer physical relations, where I am much more confident in myself  (though I do say things oddly blunt and rather sarcastic at times). \n\nI so badly want to be normal and understood, yet I feel as if such thoughts and aspirations are miles away. I have thousands of hours in gaming, and even more with the silent thoughts that cloud my head constantly, and though I may have a vast imagination, it doesn't keep the thought of being with people at bay. It's even gotten bad enough to the point that I'm failing classes in high-school due to the supposed emotions I feel. But even though I can sit and write this, potentially hoping for some amount of clarity, I still do not feel better, in fact I feel much more empty than what I did before. Day by day, I try to push off the weight of living in a society where I'll be in constant debt in minimum wages where even if I get a sufficient degree i'll still fail, the guilt of not being able to speak and communicate with my friends and teachers correctly, the sadness of having no true person to relate to, and that shame I feel for existing. I'm considering hard right now if I should go sharpen a knife and aim for all of my major arteries. It's not like anyone will truly care literally speaking, and even if they acted like they did, I highly doubt they'd feel sorry about someone like me, who has quite literally avoided contact from others for years now. I don't feel like anything matters at all, myself heavily included.  I know I won't have a life even if I live, I know that even if I die not a soul will care, and even if I try to use any good functional parts of myself to live it'll all be for nothing. I'm so tired, in many more ways than one. I don't feel myself being of any use to anyone or anything. I've squandered so many opportunities for nothing, and only commit to unrelated things that will not help me in life. I don't know myself, I don't know others, and I don't know what to do at all. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play a match of fruit ninja with myself.\n\nSorry for the terrible ranting, I know I'm not contributing at all, I just needed to rant to release some of my lingering thoughts. The more that I actually think about it, I probably should've put this in r/vent, but I honestly don't even mind at this point, and I hope the mods don't either.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\nI’m looking for some advices because I really don’t know what to do with my life.\nEnglish is not my mother tongue so please forgive my mistakes. \nI am a 35, almost 36 woman. \nI graduated engineering in 2017, but I never really liked what I was studying. I felt like I had to do something useful and that could help me get a decent job, because I don’t come from a rich family and I have to take care of myself. \nI found a job that I basically liked only for a few years, then it became hard to focus on my tasks and feel motivated.\nI sought for the help of a therapist in December 2024, after a breakup with my boyfriend of 4 years. After that everything started being worse. We had a plan to spend the life together, buy a house and be a family, and I think that was the only thing that kept my life together. \nAfter months of therapy it became clear that my luck of purpose is the main problem of my life. My mood is always very bad and depressing, and my therapist noticed that is starting getting worse. Sometimes I fell like ending my life would not be that bad, since I don’t really see a scope for my existence. I have these thoughts sometimes, like jumping from a cliff or a building, or buying a gun and end my life. It’s not that I am actively doing something, but it scares me.\nMy therapist is trying to push me to take the responsibility of my life and to stop just let it flows without control. But I don’t really know what to do. Like practically, what should I do? I don’t know and I feel constantly like I am living into the fog. \nI got a new job in May that has a lot of responsibilities, and I don’t feel like I can make it. The amount of work and the fear to not be able to make it is stressing me so much that I started feeling panic and anxiety also in the evening and when I am doing normal stuff, like grocery. My job is in banking (fintech) and our clients are of course high demanding, because a lot of money is at risk. Starting from October it will be worse, because I will have more work to do, also with budgeting and managing the product, tasks that I don’t really like and wasn’t clear I had to do when I got hired. Just the idea of what is coming terrifies me.\nBut I am also terrified of changing something. The pay is decent and I don’t have a supporting net financially speaking, so I just can’t take some time off to figure out what I would really love to do. I feel stuck. \nI hear and read of a lot of people that turn hobbies they love into a job, but I don’t feel like I have something similar in my life. \nMy therapist suggested that I contact a psychiatrist to evaluate the possibility of some medication, because she thinks that could help me to improve my mood and to have a fresh base to work on. She thinks my mood is pressuring me and metaphorically it makes me live under a snow cover, from which I can’t see opportunities. \nI would really love to have some advices and see some similar experiences.

He has expressed that he has lived multiple lives and has lived for many years. At one point he told me he had asked for his ‘eyes’ which enable him to see through people, as in see who they are or see though their lies I guess. He told me that he doesn’t care about recent political issues as he’s lived through it all countless time and it all ‘just repeats itself’ and he knows how everything is going to work out. On a few occasions he’s told me that he feels so tired of living these lives and regrets that ‘god’ gave him his ‘eyes’. He has not expressed any suicidal ideation and I don’t believe that it is currently likely but this has been slowly getting more prominent and I don’t know how this might play out in the future, I do believe he isn’t currently a risk to himself or others right now though. I’ve spoken to him about this potentially being a mental health issue and asked him to let me help him explore it with a doctor, he was very resistant to this as he feels having anything on his record might be used against him in the future but has recently agreed that he would come with me to an appointment if that’s what I want. I don’t feel there is much point in making an appointment if he isn’t going to engage fully or if he wouldn’t engage with any further assessment of support (as I can’t see any professional being able to help if he isn’t actively engaged). I really don’t know where to go from here, I know I can’t make him get help but I can’t just do nothing. I don’t even know what condition would fit with what he is experiencing. He’s always talked about a belief in past lives but never expressed such strong views as this before, he’s not a religious person and I didn’t take him seriously previously as it was just light chat. Tonight he was in tears about how tired he is of living so many lives and everything just repeating itself over and over and how it feels pointless going though it again. I’m really overwhelmed about how I can help him. Any advice is appreciated, or direction to any resources. ",

At this point, I am totally unfamiliar with that field and based on what I learned about it from the limited research I did via search engines and reading that facility's website I was able to find that it could offer more detailed insight into my mental health state and other key factors that could impact my livelihood such as my performance neurologically.\n\nAfter taking a look at this, I am thinking about doing one of these assessments and then sharing or using these results with a qualified therapist and/or psychiatrist to come up with an effective customized treatment plan for my mental health conditions instead of doing only the standard therapy with meds where two separate mental health professionals are essentially trying to figure out the best method of treatment in their field via trial and error (I would imagine it being like that since they would be basing their treatment plan off of my own anecdotal experiences from my best recollection of recent times/events which of course may not always be ideal since depression/ADHD can negatively affect my memory and brain function that makes it tougher to give a better picture of my progress with the treatment).\n\nAnyway, I just thought about posting this idea on this sub to see if there was anyone with experience in this who could offer any insight. I was hoping that my attempt at getting help this time around would result in more success if I did a neuropsychological assessment before getting an appointment in with the psychologist and therapist since my previous attempts at finding help and staying with it ultimately ended up being less successful every time I tried working with only psychologists and psychiatrists (sometimes only psychologists because the behavioral health group/facility only had psychologists but no psychiatrists on hand).\n\nOverall, I'm just tired of trying the same stuff over and over again. The idea is that I try something different this time around to see if I get a better result if there are professionals evaluating all aspects of my neurology, behavior/personality, life situation, physical health, and other aspects that may have bearing on my mental health along with the treatment of that.",

Domestic abuse almost 24/7 since the day I was born between my mom and stepdad, the crying and late nights having the cops called and threats.

Never having friends for years and the one I did have abandoning me and being all in my own again but what was new.\n\n Watching my brothers get hit with belts and even catching it once myself and always hearing them begging my stepdad to stop made me scared to say anything and hate myself for never doing anything. Constantly having my grandma act like I never stayed over there experiencing shit like being locked out of the house and having some stuff sprayed in my eyes at 10 or 11 at night. The first time I wanted to die and I prayed for death and I felt like I was losing my fucking mind. Being called fat ass when I was in school before I lost weight or when one time I got laughed at for accidentally showing my stomach which maybe it was funny but it wasn’t for me and taking my already low self esteem and pushing it down further.

    "selftext": "I'm 21F, living in Malaysia and currently in the 2nd year of my degree. I've taken to Reddit on another account talking about how afraid I've been of them, but to summarize: I've been living with abusive parents since I was born. They've been physically abusive from 7 until I was 16-17 (they stopped because I gave no more reaction to their beatings), but have always been emotionally & mentally abusive to this day. I still live with them since I don't have a job yet (they don't want me working for anybody else except them, and told me they wont support my academics if I don't work with them at any point) and they're paying for my uni fees (they forced me to go to this specific university despite telling them I've been wanting to go to another for quite a few years, threatening that they wouldn't support me at all if I didn't do as they said). I know there's the argument that I should be grateful for them and that maybe I do deserve the abuse despite being an unknowing child.\n\nFast forward to now, the reason why I'm making this post is: I've been trying to get out of the house as much as possible, using classes as an excuse (when the semester is over), but now it's not working since they found out I had no classes for a while because my mom keeps screaming at me that I've been doing illegal things and sleeping around with different men which I haven't at all been doing, but they won't believe me despite my and my friends' assurances. I don't understand why bother asking me if you're never going to take the word from the person you're asking..? They cannot understand the concept of privacy (my study room door is a glass door and I've caught them outside my room trying to listen in to my conversations with my friends on the phone) instead accusing me of being secretive and lying. I can't even be away from that toxic environment without being punished.. They just threatened to keep me locked up at home and only let me out for classes. At 21.\n\nI feel like I'm eroding from the inside out. I feel my airways restricting and headaches and fevers sprouting from the sheer anxiety I get being around them. I feel my mind decaying every second I spend with them and I've been very resilient up until this point. I used to fight back as a child because I knew I had to stand up for myself, which I'm happy because at least I have my own individuality and my own mind instead of being a suck-up to them. But for the past few years, it's been weighing on me so much so that even after I got my suicidal urges under control for the past year, these urges started appearing again because of them. I genuinely feel that if I'm found to have taken my own life, it will most definitely be because of them. For the past 10 years, I've been talking to my high school teachers, counsellors, friends, university lecturers, organizations, and therapists telling them about my experiences and for advice and most importantly for help to get me out of that household. But nothing has happened, other than them laying off the physical abuse. I've already attempted to run away twice - once around 14 and another around 18. Reported them to the police and was admitted to stay overnight at a hospital but one of the doctors there ratted me out to my parents and I was made to go back with them despite everyone knowing I was being abused. I ran back to the police station only for my mom to guilt trip and sweet talk the officers, saying that it's normal for children to be beaten. The investigating officer agreed...\n\nSo, I've really tried everything. For the past nearly a decade, I've been fighting to be my own person, I've been fighting for my own time and privacy, but now I just feel like a shell. I feel like I can't function normally outside because of how sheltered I am, and besides, I'm set to continue my studies in the UK for my third year, so I'm confused as to why they want to keep controlling me and monitoring me when what I need is independence and trust that I'll be fine without them hounding me with accusations that I can't defend because my words just fall on deaf ears. (I have a sinking feeling that my mom is planning to follow me there..) I guess what I want from this post is to know whether or not I'm crazy for wanting to be out and away from the house at the grand age of 21. I see all of my peers being able to hang out late into the night and into the early hours of the morning, have multi-day sleepovers and travel overseas with only their friends, and here I am feeling like a bird in a cage, or like a 12 year old asking permission and a signature from their parents for a class trip. I'd also appreciate any advices to calm the situation down or keep me together. Thanks for reading this far.",

I hate myself.\n\nwhenever my friend needs help with something, anything, wherever it be help with academics or mental health problems I’m always eager to help, always the first one to step up but not because I’m worried, no. Because if I help that means they’ll like me more, they’ll trust me more and I’ll be more reliable in their eyes. When other people beat me and help the person in question before me or better than me I’m overcome with envy and jealousy because that means they’ll like them more than me.\n\nIt feels like every good thing I’ve ever done to anyone was done purely because it benefited me in some way, if it doesn’t benefit me it also doesn’t interest me.\n\nI have this dark desire to be liked, I get jealous when my friends talk about their other friends, I’m afraid they like them more than me.\n\nI’m not sure if this is all of it and i might edit this post later on but this is the main of my concerns, now I’m still fairly young and maybe this is truly because I’m just a troubled teen and I’m not actually a horrible person but I don’t believed that and I have no hope in this being true, I’m a bad person and I hate myself for being like this, I wish I wasn’t a coward so I could just kill myself and get this over with ",

    "title": "I’m losing all of the hope for life and getting of these chains because of an abusive person",
    "selftext": "I don’t even know where to start, I tried to get help by calling the line for survivors of abuse, but they didn’t give me any proper instructions what should I do and how to integrate back to society, in the means of how to finally start living my life, get a enough paying job and move away. They only told me the capacity of the shelters are filled and they’re mostly accepting people who are having kids and that’s the only option they have, when it comes to helping survivors. They also told me they are not sure if the police is gonna help me if I called them, so I just came back home to that person and pretended that they didn’t do anything and I continued living the fake life by shrugging the abuse under the table for my own safety. The feeling of hopelessness started when he first called me names and when he threw his shoe at me because I disagree with his opinion, from that moment I knew that was not the person I want to spend my life with, but in my head it was kind of late to turn back and go back to my family since I run away from them to feel safer by his side in the first place. My parents  hurt me in a different way. My mother was abusive since I was a little child and she would hit me and call me names and my father would push his religion beliefs onto me which caused me to develop an OCD obsession with the religion and the fear of God and the punishment. I couldn’t even sleep normally, I was scared to fall asleep because I thought if I died in my sleep, God would punish me and send me to hell since I wasn’t a good child to my parents and the people around me. I had these horrible intrusive thoughts of how I’m gonna be buried and questioned for all of my sins, the images in my head were disturbing and it fucked me to the point where the only hope for me to fall asleep was when I saw the light from the sunshine. I also had a near death experience when I was little, I barely survived the car accident, but unfortunately for me, my parents never believed in therapy, so I had unresolved issues from a very young age which probably contributed to the ocd and anxiety/panic disorder. My romantic relationships throughout my teenage years and early adulthood were also disturbing. I remember getting into relationship with a guy who threatened me and never allowed me to have male friends, he had mysogonistic/abusive standards of relationships and how women should be treated and I knew even back then that was deeply wrong, but nothing could save me because when I came back home, I would be greeted with the same heavy feeling in my chest as I was still with him. Because of my parents behaviour, I did a sort of an irrational thing where I fled to another country to marry a guy which I thought wanted only the best for me. I really thought I finally found someone with an open mind who wasn’t shaped by the religion and who wasn’t trying to control me, I put my vulnerable self on the plate, told him everything that I am, how I developed auto-immune diseases, how I was struggling with life and because of the abuse, I didn’t know if I was neurodivergent or maybe it was just a trauma. He listened to me and in that time I thought he accepted me and he understood me, but I guess I was wrong. I was shrugging everything under the table, he called me disgusting names, told me how stupid I am, threatened me to send me back to my country, told me how I was sick in the head because I didn’t want to have children if I can’t afford them, would throw stuff at me and one day because of a discussion I had with him, he finally put his hands on my neck and started to choke me, again threatening me because my opinions and my feelings don’t matter. I clean after him, like he is a toddler, I cook and I take care of the whole household + I work full time. He knows how much a dirty environment stresses me out, but he keeps leaving shit stains and other dirty stuff around the house. Even a banana peel would end up straight on the table instead of trash. I just can’t believe people like this exist and how much they don’t care and have zero empathy towards the others. Why is that so normal? Why are we as society accepting those behaviours? I’m so ashamed of myself and so disappointed in myself, because I keep thinking of my little sister and the other women around me that I failed them and I’m so angry because there’s a lot of men who use their strength of the body and their privilege to abuse other people just because they can. And as much as I wanted to make a change by saving myself from this situation and help other women, I just keep failing and hitting a wall. My job is not even paying me bare minimum to pay for rent and food and the loophole is just continuing. I hurt my back working, so I’m scared i won’t be able to work in the future and end up in even a worse situation. I also got suicidal throughout these years, but I’m still thinking about my family and how would they react if I did something to myself, and it makes me sob.. Idk anymore, what’s the point of this life, i’m losing all of the hope, I really thought i could have a good life… ",

    "selftext": "I don't know where to start from, We broke up 3 months ago, we love each other a lot but she says her brain won't let her date me, which is okay, i get it, i understand, i can't leave her on her own, so i make sure i check up on her, take care of her food and needs. I take care of her demands as well, we were together for a year and then she moved out for college and it has been a year to that, long distance sucks, the feeling of helplessness leaves you nowhere. Anyways after the breakup she started self harming and she used to do it back in the time as well, because she comes from a orthodox strict toxic family, with me i did shut the self harm thing but it was back after the break up, she attempted suicide recently when i showed her the other sides of her life, about her brother and she is literally in the university she dreamed about, and she is finally out from home, and i showed her the other side, not taking the credit, i did say that i will inform your parents or the police if you won't listen, this is serious, my silence can costs us a life, and i can't with this, the thing is that i believe that if i was there physically, if i could hold her how she needs me to, things would be different but I have my life too, my college won't grant a leave or time won't stop for me. She lives on the other side of the country, She started smoke few months back, which is okay, i get it, you need it for your sanity okay, your call, i even get her cigg all the time because she once mentioned that getting cigg is kinda love language, i still love her, more than anything, more than myself. She doesn't have friends because everyone around is kinda toxic and she is a pure soul, she can't keep up with the girls games, guys around her don't want to be friends either they just want to hit and she knows it so she can't talk to them too. She is really alone, she doesn't believe in therapy or wants to go to doctor, half n hour ago when we were talking i offered her help, which i always do, along with it we were just talking about her and she started talking me negative with everything i say, i was talking to her and then all of the sudden she said \"i don't need your sympathy\" after a while she said \"it feels like you are attacking me\" after i explained everything, over explained it, gave her examples using all my mind, she said \"why are you treating me like i am a psycho\" first of all, i didn't say much, i asked her what makes her feel so, was it my tone, my words or anything, she replied \"i don't know\", what crux i got from the conversation is that she smokes to celebrate another week of survival, she said \"The thought of dying doesn't leave me, i want to kill myself all the time, there is a roulette of scenes, how my father said kids like me should be dead, how my school friends treated me, i can't trust anyone, this is all me this time, i believe you are a good person and i do trust you but i can't this time, my brain just shuts off everything to protect myself, i don't remember things, i don't remember what i was thinking about a minute ago but there are flashes from my past that just keeps revolving like a roulette, I don't want to live, but i have made promises to my brother (she loves her brother, she loves her younger brother, has been a mother figure to him because of toxic parents), i just started bonding with my mother i cannot take her daughter from her\" she started crying, I said it's okay if she can't rely on me, i can be a support to her, she said she is on her own this time. I am really worried about her, she smokes like 8 ciggs a day. I am just super confused what to do, even if i travel to her city it will need 400$, my parents won't lend me money, i don't have that kind of money, i live in india so teenagers working culture is fucked here. I don't know what to do, i am fucked too, but there are people who care for me, nobody is there for her. I want to hold her, hug her and take her away from this world somewhere peaceful and treat her how she deserves to be treated far from this negativity, stress, anxiety, thoughts, i can cook, I know her, she still loves me it is there, but her brain won't let her heart love me again.

    "title": "I think my online FWB committed suicide, and I might have been the last person he spoke to",
    "selftext": "I (26F) met this guy (35M) online in a sexting chatroom about a year and a half ago. It started with just sexting, but then as we got to know each other more we would video call or send photos/videos...you know. We talked about once a week. About once a month the chat would turn sexual, but the other times, we were just talking about what was going on with work or our families (without specific details, obviously). \nA few months ago, he confided that he was struggling with anxiety and depression, and I encouraged him to get on medication or go to therapy or whatever he needed to help him feel better, since he is the type of man who believes that going on medication or talking to someone about their feelings is a sign of weakness. I believe he did eventually go on anxiety meds, but we didn't really talk about it after that one conversation. Our conversations weren't generally \"emotional\" in that sense. \nTwo nights ago, we sexted for a few hours, late into the night. The conversation was normal. Fantastic, really. We both had fun, and he seemed tired, but his mood was pretty typical. I fell asleep mid-conversation at about 5am my time.\nI woke up a few hours later to my alarm, and responded to the message he'd sent me after I'd fallen asleep. \nHe immediately responded to my kissy face emoji with, \"I'm not going to be here for much longer.\" My first thought was suicide, but I wanted to be sure, so I asked him what he meant. He responded to my question with \"I feel so lost. I don't want to be here anymore.\"\nMy heart dropped, and I went into therapist mode, thinking what I would have wanted to hear if I was suicidal. I have experience with depression and suicidal thoughts, so I knew not to tell him things like \"it's not the answer\" or \"your friends and family will be heartbroken\". I asked him why he was feeling that way and tried to help him feel that he wasn't alone in the thoughts he was having. I told him that I had been suicidal a few times in my life and had struggled with feelings of hopelessness. He sent me a photo of one of his guns and said \"Just staring at it.\" I tried calling him, but he didn't pick up. I asked him if he had people he could talk to about this or go be with (I really didn't know anything about his social life, and all I knew about his family was that he had a long-lost half brother that they'd just found through DNA, a mom that \"hated\" him, and a son. I'd never asked about anything related to his family; he'd offered all that information freely). He said he was staying at his brother's house, but he didn't want to bother him while he was at work. I told him that his brother would much rather he said something than not, even if it \"bothered\" him, and he told me he would talk to him. He said \"I promise I'll be fine.\" I told him about the 988 hotline and said that he could talk to someone there as well and that they'd helped me in the past. He said he didn't want to talk to a stanger and would talk to his brother later. \nI asked him to at least text his brother now and maybe get out of the house and away from his guns. I told him I didn't want him to be alone.\nHe hasn't responded since. \nI've messaged a couple more times, asking if he was safe, but the messages haven't been opened, so he's either ghosting me or he's actually dead.\n\nI'm sick to my stomach about this. I can't talk to anyone in real life because of fear of judgment from my really religious/conservative friends and family who would be horrified I had even met a random man online let alone that I've been sexting him regularly for almost two years. I'm not so heartbroken that I need to tell someone real. I wasn't emotionally invested in this man. He was practically a stranger. I've thought about ending things with him so many times over the last year, but I haven't because he's really the only man who has shown continued interest in me lately, even if it is a surface level sexual interest. \nI just feel terrible that I might have been the last person he spoke to or the only one he confided in and I wasn't even able to help much because I live three states away and am just the girl he called when he got horny.\n\nI just need someone else to know what happened and to virtually give me the hug my mom would give me if I could tell her without her hating me.\n\n(Or maybe if anyone has a way that I could change the story to somehow not include me having a long-distance fwb so I could explain to my family why I've been so somber and I don't have to keep pretending that nothing happened.)",

    "selftext": "im 16f and i am going through a lot at such a young age. First, i was molested by my cousin. Everybody made me the villain. Been gaslighted, manipulated and went through every mental torture u can possibly think of. I am a deeply sensitive and emotional person that feels everything deeply. I am also an empath and i have major trust issues. We moved to canada and i healed for a bit. I reached out to my family that i needed professional help. They said it was too expensive and so i had to do my own healing and parenting cuz my parents and whole family sucks. Basically i dont have anybody to turn to and there was a time i begged God for a hug. When i thought everything was getting better, here i am, back in that dark place. So my dad is left in my home country and he doesnt wanna support us at all nor does he wanna come with us. My mom got into a relationship with this guy. We met the guy’s 2 kids one boy and one girl. The boy is the same age as me. At first, we were cool and i prayed and cried to God to let us stay with them and potentially move in with them. So my prayers got answered but it wasnt what i expected it to be. I am miserable. I have 3 siblings and they all get along so well with the guy’s 2 kids. I do too but i would get left out so much. The guy who was the same age as me, lets call him “A” basically he was very nice and sweet at first. Always helping me out even if i dont ask and following me around the house. Over time i realized maybe he kind of liked me and we did have tension and chemistry between us. He made it kind of clear because he was always staring at me and doing couple stuff like holding me by my waist, eating from the same thing, always close to me. I kind of liked him too and then he got a girlfriend. He was still doing that even tho he had a gf and when i said “is ur gf gonna be ok with u being this overprotective?” after he was holding my hand entagled and everything. He said we were platonic and that kind of hurt me but yeah i decided to distance myself abit cuz he had a girl. Then, he broke up with his girl and then was being more bold and touchy with me. Its partially my fault for folding and kind of reciprocating the same energy he was giving because it felt nice to be chosen for once or feel chosen and his eyes was always on me. I thought wow and then fast forward to now, we are living together. He turned cold. So cold. It all started when i called my guy friend and he called me fine shi and pretty and complimented me then A got mad. He yelled “Fuck you” to the guy as a joke apparently? then left the room after my guy friend complimented me. He was laughing trying to brush it off smiling but i could tell something was off. He started ignoring me and making mean jokes about me in front of everyone. I talked to him and said “are you mad at me?” and he said “uhhhhhh” i dont know how to feel about him. I said i couldnt fall for this guy because hes a walking red flag and i caught him multiple times lying down on my sister who was a year younger than me and being all close and touchy like the fuck? So i kind of called the guy friend on purpose bc i did not want him to be catching feelings because WE ARE LIVING TOGETHER. WE ARE ABOUT TO BE STEPSIBLINGS. Its so fucking awkward i cant even. I dont know how to act around him. Hes just so mean and im not even doing anything to him. Everything is going so fucking wrong. I know i sound overdramatic but the emotional pain i feel. Its too much. We cant even go to school yet. This is the same man who let me sleep on his lap and was holding me. I have so many fucking traumas. I turned to God and i dont know why but i feel so far away from him again. I overthink everything. I need help. Im getting suicidal thoughts. Im thinking of harming myself but i love myself and ive been through so much and am still going through so much. I feel so alone AGAIN. I dont even have my own room no privacy yet because the fucking basement is still getting renovated. I swear somebody is fucking praying on my downfall because everything is going so wrong and i dont know if it will get better. I dont know how to cope. I dont know. I need help. Please. I have feelings too. Im a human too. I have a pure heart. I just want to love and be loved. Is that so wrong? Is that too much to ask? Everything is so fucking overwhelming. Im a good person. I show love and i care but why is everyone so mean to me? You have no idea how hard it is. One mean joke. ONE SMALL LITTLE JOKE is enough to keep me up crying at night. Its too much. Why is it me? why is it always me?",

I kinda get it, at first glance I would probably be inclined to believe them too, but for some reason everyone seems to think I am about to kick the bucket any one of these days. At extremes, I even feel like some people attempt to make their plans around it. I'm fairly normal, I do have my \"oddities\" like going to bed late and keeping to myself. I go to university and have passed all of my classes except one, and the one I didn't pass wasn't one I intended on failing on anyways, but the score I got was so abnormally low, I'm practically writing it off as if I had never taken that course anyways, although I did and scored really well on almost all aspects. For some reason people around me have been walking on eggshells some days and other days they barely make any effort at avoiding pointing out all the real or imagined things in my life that I should be sad or miserable about. \n\nAt the start of the summer, before my exams, when I had no reason to feel down or upset, I got into a disagreement with my father after which he essentially forced me to go and talk to a therapist. Twice. I think the first time was just at a clinic where I paid with cash, and the second was at the hospital, where my visit went through the system and used my health insurance or whatever. At the hospital, there were no issues at the front desk and with the folks with billing and my health plan, the doctor I talked to agreed that my visit was completely unnecessary and he told my father that as well. A few weeks later, my father showed me some kind of invoice with some random phone number on it that may or may not have been official. It turns out, at that point, there was an issue with my health plan and I was being billed for a hospital visit I didn't need to go to or even asked to go to. It especially sucks that at that point I just went to the hospital to avoid escalating things with my family. The issue with the invoice got resolved thankfully, but the incident is still hard to put behind.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that for some reason, people seem to think I don't have much longer to live, even though I am perfectly healthy. How do I convince friends and family that I am normal and am not going to jump off a bridge anytime soon?",

It’s been so long, and I’m not really getting better, even though I’ve tried to improve my mental state. I’m just so tired. A friend told me I should stop taking my medications, but I don’t know if he’s right or if he just doesn’t understand my life. I’m confused and really need advice. Please help.\n",

Then she laid on that friends bed sobbing and retching before vomiting in G's bathroom. They went to the hospital and she had to have her stomach pumped, then she went on a 72 hour hold in the psych ward. She was then given a state mandated psychologist, later a psychiatrist and is on anti depressants. She still talks about it. All the time. And she self harms. The reason she had attempted before was because she couldn't handle the stress of college with working part time. \n\nShes ruined our friend group. That F refuses to be alone with her, and i have to play mediator. F had lost a friend to suicide in middle school and has a lot of trauma surrounding it. Shes told me privately that shes waiting to move away because she's afraid a clean break will lead G to suicide. I feel trapped. And I think part of me hates her. G talks constantly about how much she hates her therapist, anytime i try to talk about the future she just nods along, but I know that as soon as things get hard she'll just attempt again. She fixates on suicide and get obsessed with characters and actors who play suicidal characrers. She told me she fantasies about her favorite actor putting a gun to her head a blowing her brains out. Im tired. And its exhausting walking on eggshells and treating her like a child. I suggested she lower her hours to avoid what happened last year happening again but she just nods along. Im so so fucking tired of it. She doesnt want to change, she doesn't want to stop see harming or starving herself. I love her but I'm just so tired of it.  And then I feel guilty for being tired of it. But recently it's hard to not say anything. Its hard to politely ignore the thinspo she has on her homescrreb, and the new cuts she shows up with. Sometimes I fantasize about how much happier we'd all be if we were all mentally stable. Or if she just WANTED to be better.",

Neither was i??\n\nAlmost never went to my gymnastics shows. Told me he'd rather go to dance class and asked me (a child) if it was fine he did that instead. What was i gonna say? \"No i want you to go to my show even though you dont want to\"????\n\nTalked crap about my friends to me. \"X has a t-shirt on that shows her shoulder. You only do that when you're dating.\" \"Y looks like one big apology when she walks through a door.\" \"These two from your class are dating? You're 14/15 years. They don't even know what love IS\". (Meanwhile he dated when he was 14 so i guess hes just better than them)\nI repeated those things that he saidto me to my friends  because i thought that was acceptable and I was super unpopular because of it and even my friends' parents didn't like me. (Probably still doesnt)\n\nHe did everything in his power to make me feel like I couldn't drop out of this one-year school i was in  that was completely voluntary and where you would live a year. Told him about dissociation and anxiety in school. Told him if he had any idea how horrible i had it he would never ever ask me to go back. He said if I dropped out I should find a job (???) A few years later he acts shocked when I say I was suicidal at the time.\n\nI got too drunk one night because of the wine being 3 times stronger than what i was used to. I was alone with a new guy for the first time. Dad wouldnt pick me up or get me a taxi. He wanted me to sleep there. The guy called my dad so we could talk to him. The dude asked what my address was. But i didnt want to say it in front of the dude and my dad went \"you cant even remember where you live?\" Then he gave my address and the guy walked me home. The guy wanted to sleep in my bed. The next day my dad asked why the guy didnt sleep over.\n\nWants me to work in a prison as a guard despite me never wanting that but he keeps suggesting it and sending links. He wants me around rapists???\n\nTakes 5 trips a year with his girlfriend. I come once every other year\n\nJokes about drugs (sends a picture of a t-shirt with Snow White snorting something white) but can't remember what I was addicted to and never talks to me about it\n\nSaid if I ever did drugs again he would report my friend (dealer) to the police. Said the same day that if I relapsed I should tell him.\n\nHe Told a friend of his who i see at my job that i took drugs\n\nI was often upset as a child. When I cried he asked me roughly to stop. He also does this to foster children when he forces them to do schoolwork even though they don't go to school yet\n\nHis motto when I was little was that if you can do it yourself, you should do it yourself. My first words were \"ka selv\" which means \"i can do it myself\" I never learned to ask for help. It doesn't even occur to me to ask for help.\n\nIn the new house he moved into with his girlfriend and me, there is not a single piece of evidence outside my room that I live there. Even a hair tie i put some place gets removed. (I have shoes by the door and a tiny water fountain i requested outside so i guess theres something) no pictures, nothing ive made.\n\nWhen we have to do something or people are visiting, he snaps at me and when we were celebrating my birthday I didnt put up with it and he said \"YOU can go away now!\" when I was literally just helping him do something. Never apologizes for this\n\nHe doesn't drive me anywhere. He doesn't pick me up from anywhere. Always been like that.  It's only my mother that does. It's always been that way. He only wants to if it's minimally inconvenient\n\nHe doesn't even know what i eat on my bread in the morning. I eat liver pâté (normal where i live) that he buys for our dog because when I ask him to buy something for me when he goes to the store he says I can do it myself\n\nHe doesn't know which days I work even tho it's been the same 3 days for 2 years\n\nI often stay with the kids or dogs when he has to do something but when my brother and his girlfriend did it a while back he took them, his girlfriend and the Forster kids to a vacation home as a thank you and does it exactly when i have work and expects me to just ask to get off work and use my single 2 days off i get a month to go there. Obviously i didnt. It often happens that he plan things to exactly when I have work. This time as an apology he said he would buy what i wanted from the German border (only what was on sale) When he came back the only thing he had bought was one single can of mojito because \"all the other things you had picked had dissappered out of the digital basket\"\n\nHe has OCD, anxiety, ADHD, misophonia but doesn't go to a psychologist and refuses to take medication\n\nHis last 4 girlfriends had a psychopath as a husband when he met them and he says \"I like to save them\". My mother herself says she would have left him if he hadn't done so much for her. He knows (subconsciously maybe) he can treat them worse because they will put up with it. He ofc talk about his relationship problems to me\n\nWhen I worked 56 hours a week he wouldnt let me sleep in the morning. He talked loudly in the living room without closing the door. He vacuumed. He let the dog run around in the hallway. He made noise and let the foster children make noise outside my door.\n\nI dont even know what to do because when i told him to not just tell the children to stop crying he came up with excuses. When i told him he speaks badly to his girlfriend he said thats just the way he talks. Its one thing he was an asshole when i was growing up but he still is being a shitty person. I have a very strong sense of fair-ness and nothing about him is fair. Sure i could just live with my mom but i want him to know all of this shit hes done but even if i tell him he'll just forget in a week and do nothing about his behavior\n\n\nEdit: just realized there is one picture im also in in the hallway",

I taught myself how to tie a noose before I knew long division.

Nobody gets it. My entire life has been some sort of chaotic pity party of my own design, where the only constant is my misery. Without it im alone, basically. It’s an almost comforting feeling to have. \n\nThe first time I attempted I was around year 4, so around nine years old. I was a Harry Potter nerd, and mimicking the way one of the characters ‘killed himself’, I choked myself. I kept on going until I passed out, and then when I woke up I vomited blood and just kept going on with life. I didn’t tell anyone, didn’t hint at it. Nobody knew until last year, six years after I attempted because I accidentally revealed it to a friend. \n\nI’ve always struggled with self harm. When I was a kid I’d just scratch at myself until I was red and raw, as I got older I got more elaborate. I’d cut myself with broken plastic, I’d punch things until my knuckles bled, I’d burn myself with whatever I could get. I would set paper on fire and hold it as it burnt just to feel something. When I got to highschool I finally discovered razors. I’d cut anywhere easy to hide. I’d cut my fingers and just bandage them, nobody questioned it because I’d always get injured easy. \n\nWhen I first started highschool I attempted again, that time with an overdose. I swallowed a bunch of pain meds, Panadol or nuerofen, I forget which one. Either way, I found out the hard way it’s not a lethal overdose with them. I just got sick afterward. I didn’t tell anyone. I didn’t even leave a note when I attempted. \n\nI only told people about that one too last year, during a breakdown. Last year i attempted again, i stood in the middle of a road and just waited for a car to come. It never did. \n\nI’ve picked up habits to try and deal with it. I’d steal alcohol from my parents, I’d smoke cigarettes, I’d go on long walks in silence. Nothing ever works. \n\nPeople come and go, everything is fleeting, but my hatred stays forever. I fucking hate myself. I hate everything about me, i feel sick. And it’s pathetic even writing it down. There’s something wrong with me. Something so vile inside me making me feel this way. But there’s never been a time I haven’t felt like this. Am I even me without my never ending sadness? \n\nI don’t even know who I am. I am constantly playing a role to appease others. I’m always ‘happy’ and ‘joyful’, im ‘talkative’ and ‘energetic’. Nobody ever suspects that im planning my suicide every day. How it’s going to go down. If im jumping off a bridge or hanging myself. When it’s happening. How im going to pull it off. I can never tell anyone. There’s no worse feeling than people worrying about me. I don’t even like thinking or caring about myself, I don’t want other people doing so. \n\nMaybe im not going to do it.

I didn’t know what was wrong with me and why I was so mad all the time. I pushed myself away from everyone I knew, used self harm as a coping mechanism and ended up attempting suicide when I was 15. I was lucky that my dad found me when he did. Otherwise I would not be here to write this. \n\nI started to remember the assault when I was 17, and had my first sexual encounter with another guy. I remember that I broke down, crying, and that the guy I was seeing, just left me. Yeah I know. Total douche. I spoke to my parents about it, and they just dismissed the incident, arguing that we were both kids and it was only a game that I misremembered. I never believed that excuse. I ended up going no contact with my family as long as they included my abuser in their family. It felt like they chose him over me, even if I was the victim. \n\nI struggled for a few years after that. I had some friends left from school, but they all seemed to fade away after a while. I felt alone. I stared self harming again. And after reaching an all time low, I attempted suicide again when I was 21. But again, as luck would have it, I was found in time again. Recovery was slow, but I started therapy for the abuse, and finally managed to stop blaming myself for everything that happened with my family. \n\nI was doing okay for a couple of years. Got a steady job that I like. I don’t love it, and its not my dream job, but I have great colleagues and planned on how to find my dream job. But lately, some things seemed to start to fall apart again. \n\nI thought I was doing okay. But now it feels like everything is fading. My friendships fall apart and my dreams feel more distant than ever. I’m turning numb again. Unable to really feel happy or excited about anything. I’m isolating myself again. \n\nBut this time, I will not fall, I will not give up. Because I still have one thing left. Myself. And even though I feel alone, angry, sad and depressed, I still feel. I still breathe. I will get over it, like I have so many times. Not because others needs me or love me. Not because I need others. Because I need myself. I need to feel these things to get through them. And hopefully, one day I will find happiness within myself, regardless of others. \n\nBut until that day, I will cry, I will falter, I will lose hope. But that’s alright. Cause that only means that I’m alive. My heart is still beating. My lungs are still breathing. I can still watch a beautiful sunset, or listen to amazing music. I can still feel the wind on my skin, and taste wonderful food. There is so much to this life that we sometimes forget about, that brings so much joy. \n\nWe can all start with something small. Like the way grass dance in the wind, or birds chirping in the early morning. How the snow slowly falls on a still night, or how the smell of rain can bring back so many memories. Hold on to these things. Cause this is life. Its chaotic, but at the same time balanced. There is no light without the dark, no warmth without the cold. And no life without death. But that doesn’t mean we should race towards one, ignoring the importance of the other. So today, I chose myself. Not to ignore the pain and sadness, but to embrace it. Today is just the start of the rest of my life, no matter how good or bad it might be. ",

    "selftext": "For some time now I’ve been struggling, a lot more than I have been throughout my life. I’ve always been a pretty depressed and lonely person but for some reason it’s gotten 10x worse in the past 2 years. Throughout my whole life my feelings and mental state has been invalidated and I’ve been mocked and bullied by some of my own family for feeling the way I feel. I can’t control it, especially when I’m in panic or a lot of pain mentally. I’m always exhausted physically and mentally and they just tell me to “get a grip”. \n\nFor the record I am autistic, I was diagnosed when I was very young so it’s not new information that my brain works differently to theirs but for some reason now that I’m an adult they expect me to act like I just don’t have it? I don’t know if they think when you hit a certain age a-lot of the struggles you may have as an autistic child just goes away (it definitely doesn’t) and they make me feel so worthless and insecure about myself because I react to situations or arguments the only way I’ve ever known how which is cry, lock myself in my bedroom and have a panic attack. \n\nI have always felt different to my family, I’ve never truly fit in but I’m feeling that even more so now. Everyday there is another argument or comment that someone makes that makes me feel like I shouldn’t be here. I do so much to help them and everyone else in my life but when I’ve begged to have some support in doing something for my mental health they do nothing. It’s like they think I’m being dramatic or overexaggerating how I feel when I’m truly not. I’ve told them about the thoughts of relapse or ending my life. I’ve told them about how their tone or them laughing at me makes me feel uncomfortable and worthless. Still, they don’t care. \nMy siblings have always been put above me but I thought that’ll at-least stop when we all become adults but wow was I wrong. Whenever my mum shouts at me or blames me for something my mind goes back to being that little girl. The little girl that was scared to even cry around her because she’d “give me something to cry about”. I’m so protective over my younger self because of all the pain and trauma she went through but shes still me and growing up I’ve only ever went through more pain and more suffering. They don’t realise how bad my mind is literally everyday, they don’t care about what they’re doing to me and how they’re breaking me apart more and more. It’s getting to the point where I’m thinking of ‘the only way out’ more and more and it scares me because I don’t want to turn to that again but I don’t want to be here if this is all my life is going to be. I can’t work so I can’t make money to move out and I have nowhere else to go. I just feel so stuck and so lost and it’s only ever getting worse. ",

    "selftext": "For context: the cornered edge framing of a metal shed roof I was helping build at church fell on the back of my head in late October. It was my third concussion/whiplash in that spot [july 2019, May2023] and I went through a death metal phase gig phase in the summer of 2022/3. So I’ve still got most of my cognition, it’s balance and homeostasis mechanics that were fucked. \n\nIt’s now almost a year since then. I have no true friends because I’ve pushed them away, and my relationship with my parents and sister are tense. I just get so frustrated, angry, irritable and tired and moody that I just fly off the handle or sulk, and I either don’t want to expose people to that, or I have without meaning to and they’ve left or they and have to tiptoe around me. My mood and capacity and pain level is so unpredictable, so I am unreliable.\n\nI’ve [20FTM] struggled with ADHD and my mental health long before this, and if anything this was a wake up call for me to look at myself and my life and figure out what I really want etc. etc. That’s not exactly the problem. I’d argue that if it wasn’t for this injury I’m in the best place. It’s just overstimulation, vestibular disorders, and chronic pain.\n\nI said FTM specifically because the last time I went through something similar and burnt every bridge from substance abuse, exhibiting similar behaviour for example, I was not perceived as masculine at all. And 3 years later after rebuilding my life, I look, sound and cry like a man. Which is what I want! Great! But now I’m the angry man in the house, and my words, tone, volume and actions carry A LOT more weight now. I’ve experienced an angry man in my house from the perspective of a girl, and now that I am that man, I don’t know how to handle my anger or what to do to fix it.\n\nMy point is, the world is always spinning too fast and I keep losing my footing and my head hurts all the time when I’m around other people. so I feel defenceless and weak and out of control so I lash out to try to control the environment. I give up a lot of the time because I can’t relax unless I’m on my own. I’ve pulled myself out of hell many times on my own, and being so defensive is ruining my relationships.\n\nVoices are like nails on a chalkboard, and footsteps are like broken glass. It’s like if someone was chewing really loudly or clicking a pen repeatedly during an exam, that type of rage but ALL THE TIME. So I don’t bother, and now I’m sitting here lonely with no one else to blame but myself.",

I've been trying to meet somebody and improve myself to earn it and everything I've been told to do. All that since I was like 20 and I have nothing to show for any of it.

I have no one and nothing to celebrate for or with. \n\nI don't want to be alive and live the rest of my life alone tbh but I at least have to outlive my mom and my grandmother.

It's always there, a gash running through my heart that I feel ache and hurt with every pump. \n\nI just give up. Maybe if I just admit to myself that it'll never happen I can stop holding on to this tiny miniscule amount of hope that's causing me to rot from the inside out.

I'm sure the pain will never stop but maybe if I just accept my situation it'll lessen and be more bearable. \n\nI give up. All I'll ever have is me. The only person that'll ever care or be there for me is me. Whatever happens in my life all the ups and down it'll only ever be me celebrating or making it through.

    "selftext": "Too much on my mind to form a cohesive title. I just want to vent into the void that is a Reddit thread. \n\nI am a 17 year old Canadian high school student, I am a white queer woman in a Catholic school. And I fear that being an empathetic person is slowly killing me, I fear that hatred is consuming me and everyone I know and love. I don’t know what my intentions are with this post, but I am tired of living entirely in my head. \n\nAs a white person, I grew up with a very sheltered idea: that racism was essentially extinct in the modern day, i thought it was a thing of the past, slavery was over, segregation was over, and everyone loved each other for their differences. I know, this is a silly thing to say. But I went to an extremely diverse elementary school, white people making up only around half the class. I was taught to not see people for what they look like, I never saw any reason to think otherwise. And while I’m sure some of my peers had been in situations where they were disadvantaged or oppressed for their ethnicity, I never observed anything like this with my own eyes, and therefore, assume it wasn’t a rampant issue at the time. I was taught in school about the importance of the environment, I figured protecting it was so obvious that it would fix itself, that people would care. I tried my best not to judge people without knowing their situation, I grew and learned not to hate people, even though most of the kids were assholes to me. \n\nCovid happened near the end of sixth grade, around that time I discovered that I was queer (identified as a lesbian for a while but currently lean more bisexual). I spent a lot of time online during the pandemic, on TikTok and whatnot, I was always given very left leaning content, further emphasizing my childish ideas that oppression was dead. I wasn’t uncomfortable with my sexuality, i didn’t go around telling people, but it was more because I didn’t find it to be a very noteworthy thing, not because I was ashamed in any way. When I had gone back to school, I let people know who I was, I didn’t find shame in any of it. Some kids were kind of jerks about it but I never took it seriously. Kids like to say offensive things to seem edgy. Even when people would call me a fag or whatever, I was confident enough to not care. They were children and were perpetuating the outdated beliefs of their parents or of the church (Catholic school). \n\nI don’t know why I always had this strange me vs the rest observation of the kids around me. The way I’d observe them as children who didn’t know any better despite the fact that I was the same age as them.\n\nAround this time, I observed things like the George Floyd movement on tv, I knew racism and prejudice was real and yet, I always felt detached from it, like such a big thing wasn’t going to find me in a small city. Like everyone was against it. I only heard these stories from the side of those who resisted and assumed everyone was for the change. My childish optimism struck again, I wasn’t angry about it. \n\nDespite being out of the closet, nobody in my early years of high school cared that I was gay, to be fair, nobody really knew who I was so maybe that’s why. I think it definitely sparked the attention of people but I read it as more curiosity than discrimination. Near the end of 9th grade, a homophobic hate crime occurred to one of the older students at my school. Without giving away too many details, a groups of boys disturbed a demonstration/ event held by lgbtq students at my school, they ripped their signs, stomped on their flags, yelled derogatory statements at them and even threw objects at them, leading to a girl being mildly injured. Despite this, I never felt unsafe, most of my peers found this funny and I agreed with them to fit in. Obviously the situation was bad but I found it more absurd than scary. \n\nBut as I got older, throughout 11th grade and now approaching 12th grade. I’ve begun to understand the severity of the truth. Kids are being consumed by some kind of evil, and it is coming from their phones. It would start with the little things, people would complain about immigration and its ties to unemployment, they’d make little jokes about disabled or queer people. I was sometimes alarmed but I knew these people didn’t have bad intentions, they were just kids speaking their mind. Then it would turn into more specific things, boys stereotyping girls, a rise in bad behaviour in the classes taught my women, more significantly than those led by men, I noticed racist comments by adults around me, people who I’d consider friends. Then, it got worse, stories of friends being sexually assaulted by their boyfriends, alt right boys spreading hate on girls, sharing their nudes and exploiting them. Friends of mine having vendettas against certain races, going as far as to want them dead. \n\nI know that the algorithms are doing it to them, I can’t go a day without seeing a racist video or post. And while I had come across them before, the difference now is the lack of push back against it. Nobody has empathy, the comments agree, people I know like and repost these things. \n\nAnd the more I see the more my eyes are open. Little things that once went over my head now make sense. Girls hating on those who conform because they’ve learned to devalue things that are stereotypically feminine (ex: pop stars, pink, lululemon, etc). The infantilizing way people treat kids that are different to them, being nice in a way that’s mean (ex: “omg we’re like best friends” “awe wait guys I love him” “why don’t you talk, omg stop ur so quiet”). The way that at my diverse school, every friend group is mostly homogenous in terms of race. \n\n\nI find myself at a strange crossroads, I feel that it’s ignorant for me to ignore the reality of what many people face, but at the same time, I long for the naive oblivion I once had. I don’t want to hate the oppressor, I don’t want to hate anyone. But I do, I hate everyone around me, I fail to see that the evil inside of them doesn’t make up their personhood. \n\nI watch the news, I see horrible acts fuelled by hate, in places like Palestine or Afghanistan. I can’t live knowing how much hate is in the world, how many people I act with on a daily basis hold these ideologies, how many people like me suffer by the hands of an oppressor simply because they were born in an unlucky place. \n\nI’m scared, I’m scared for the future. I’m afraid to get married, what if my spouse falls down the pipeline, they begin to be racist and cruel to people. I’m afraid to have children, what do I do when my son takes advantage of a girl because he’s been desensitized to violence from content online. I’m afraid to approach these topics with the people I already know and love in my life, because I know I won’t like their answer. I’m afraid of myself, the unconscious biases that weren’t present a few years ago, the judgement inside of me that grows every day. \n\nI’m afraid to grow in a world full of hate, where almost everyone I know is miserable, where every man and woman is tired, where every child will grow into something evil. I just don’t know how much longer I can do it. \n \nI don’t know why I wrote so much, I don’t know if anyone will read this or care. But I guess I’m wondering what I should even do? How do I live my life happily while knowing of all those who suffer around me. ",

I have done so much talk therapy, DBT, medications and “life style changes.” \n\nI am 24f, I have three kids, been divorced once and remarried. I have had so many traumas and triggers as I’m sure most of us do. I have had so many highs and lows but right now, my low is LOW.

    "selftext": "Hi, I’m at a loss for what to do in this situation. \n\nShort story (please ask if there’s something you want to know) - I waited for a trauma specialist and got one, or so I thought, he didn’t want to go into my traumas only deal with the trauma responses. Which I started to have questions about after a few months. I started getting really suicidal and it was honestly the worst couple of months of my life, in and out of the psychiatric ER and endless calls to help lines + trying to get help from the psychiatrists clinics Emergency team (my therapist was at this time non responsive, ducked any responsibility and stopped filling my prescriptions. Got to know he was holding big meetings on dealing with suicidal thoughts and depression. Which is, funny to me in retrospect. \n\nAnyway, after that period he agreed to put me on a WL for a trauma specialist (like I was promised at first) but without warning threw me out of the line and out of the entire clinic. It’s government driven. \n\nI now stand without any psychiatric help, no way to contact help (other than the ER) and I’ve been through a ton of stress lately, old traumatic feelings have resurfaced and my mother has done some of the worst things to me in this time period, so I’m really struggling. Was supposed to start school 2 weeks ago, haven’t been able to, my stress levels are through the roof. I’m just an anxious panicky blob of a human right now. \n\nThe world feels not real, I feel like I’m not real, and I know what that means, I’m terrified of having back to back panic attacks again. My birthday last week was spent like that and I dream a lot of stressful things and wake up every two hours drenched in sweat and high anxiety. The dreams are so vivid I can recall exactly how the buildings/rooms/houses looked, what the people looked like/were doing, what they said, I can even remember the code to the building I asked a woman driving by on a bike to a lawyers office, 2279, and his office number 217. She didn’t work at the lawyers office she was just biking by, her office building was right next to it but she had an acquaintance at the law firm that she knew would help me. This is a dream I had 4 days ago. And I still remember all of that + her face. It’s like my brain is super intensely focused on every detail. It’s exhausting frankly. I usually love that trait about myself, that I’m extra sensitive and observant.  But now it’s just making me store all this information I don’t need because my brain is panicking and think I need to know everything all the time so the atomic detail. \n\nI live in Scandinavia which means we have 4 seasons, I starting to think that may be playing a part in this, every autumn I get more sensitive and panicky. And it gets worse every year. My family is nonexistent, so there’s really nothing left for me here. I’ve thought about moving south, where the weather is warmer, but that’s also scary, to do all by myself. \n\nThe only thing regulating me is weed but it keeps me in a loop of “laziness” my mind and body gets too heavy and that also triggers anxiety because I’m “just existing without a purpose” and missing school. I want to be mentally good enough to live my life, this is holding me back, I want to get better I’m not even dwelling. It’s so fucking unfair that I got through my childhood just to get hit in the face(or brain I guess) as an adult with this. I tried to write this post in a way that didn’t trigger a panic attack while writing, so I hope that you understand what I mean. \n\nI almost constantly have a panicky, unrealistic reality \nFeeling about life now, after having a really good period before all of this. It just feels like my purpose on this earth was to go through a shit ton of trauma (literally every year of my life the past 24 years has at least 3 or more traumas, that’s not normal..)to grow up and become an anxious mess. I feel like im a science project some vile researcher put me in. What a privilege to able to name why you’re losing yourself. Not being able to pinpoint what’s causing this, what specific trauma out of all of them (or maybe combined). Is a nightmare. I educate myself a lot on mental health, but I don’t think I can help myself out of this one, this time. I’m tired of hitting the lowest lows and having to climb myself up with all my force and energy. Multiple times a year. \n\nI have a lot of ambitions and big dreams for myself, this thing I didn’t even give myself is holding me back, and it’s making me mad and panicky on and off, I don’t want this, I thought somehow I would get rewarded for making it through everything, like finally getting rest and things going right, but I grew up and the whole world is too much now. \n\nI love connecting with people deeply, making strangers smile, travel, be one with your body, I’m quite spiritual. But even if that’s me, wholeheartedly, there is nothing holding back the panic attacks knocking that knocks me off my feet again. It’s unfair that I have to be scared to go to bed at night, scared of what my brain will make me see in my dreams and how it will feel. I feel every stab in my body as if they were real, I feel the pain and sorrow like I see it through myself and another person I care about. Wake up drenched and already having anxiety before even getting a chance at being myself for the day. I’m so tired, I’m sad. I don’t want to lose hope but I feel so lonely it’s honestly breaking my heart. And I’m scared that one time I’ll get a panic attack so bad I’ll never find my way back to myself again. \n\nFeel free to ask if there’s something that’s unclear, note, English is not my first language. \n\nI appreciate any and every tip you can give, I’m open like a book, I want to get better. ❤️‍🩹 \n\n",

The only way to guarantee for it to stop is to not be here. That's the only way.\n\nI've been living like this for 2 years now and it's so bad. \n\nI've always been anxious, but this is just too much to take anymore. \n\nI feel like I just need to scream at the top of my voice to let all these feelings out. \n\nThis constant panic and fear is so, so overwhelming. It makes me not want to do anything or go anywhere. \n\nMy marriage has broken down, my health and fitness have taken a massive nosedive. I look a mess, I have no pride in my appearance. I have no confidence to work - I am broken beyond repair. \n\nThe only positive in my life is that my beautiful little boy loves me and he needs me. \n\nThe thought or idea of suicide was my 'comfort blanket', it was my way out! It was always there as my escape. Since having my little boy, someone who really needs me in his life, that comfort blanket, that escape route has been removed. It's not his fault at all, and, to the outside world, that's completely irrational, but it's my love for him. I love him more than I ever thought humanly possible. \n\nAm I trying to distance myself from him, so he doesn't get too attached and grows not to need me?

What is my other comfort blanket? What else will make me feel safe?  I don't think I am ever going to escape from my anxiety, so what else can I do?

Scared, scared of everything. I just want to be put out of my misery. \n\nThe only thing that will make me feel better is death. I have given up and I'm waiting to die. But then, I'm anxious about dying? Make that make sense? \n\nWhat will help me? Because I really need help!! \n\nI need something so powerful that it stops me feeling this way, but the question is what? ",

    "title": "Old Guy Needs Coping Help",
    "selftext": "My anxiety is at its worst at night, and I have been racking my brain trying to figure out ways to cope when this happens. \n\nI don’t have dreams, or at least I don’t remember any if I do. I’ll constantly just wake up 2-4 hours before my alarm goes off in a panic sweat. My anxiety all stems around work. I was in the military, but I was injured and medically separated after 6 years in. That feeling of having a 20yr plan only to lose it all, was the starting point of my anxiety.  \n\nMy military medical retirement doesn’t pay me enough to live, it wouldn’t even cover my mortgage, so I had to find full time work to take care of my family. I found work but was fired from that job (while I was on vacation) and lost everything because I couldn’t find a comparable paying job in over 2 years. My home was foreclosed, my car repossessed, and finally I declared bankruptcy. I’ve never felt so low in my life. If it weren’t for my little kids, I honestly may have ended it. \n\nThat was 12 years ago. Since then I’ve clawed my way back up. I have a great job, a nice home, and all my needs are taken care of. So what do I have to be anxious about? My anxiety stems from the thought of losing it all again.  It’s currently 4:30 am, 2 hours before my alarm will go off. My brain woke me up and all I can think about is “What if my Boss dies or retires? I’ll lose everything and have to start all over again…”. I work for a small company that’s owned by a single guy. Every day I go to work and wonder if today’s the day I’ll be fired.  \n\nThen I start panicking, I’m 44 years old. Nobody’s going to hire an old guy. I work in Tech, one of the harshest fields for aging employees. I have friends and family members in I.T. that have been out of work for months due to the poor economy. If that happens to me, I’ll lose it all again. \n\nLosing everything the first time nearly drove me over the edge. I’m too old to start over again. I’m the person everyone depends on. My parents borrow money, my siblings borrow money, my wife doesn’t have a career (she gave that up to marry me when I joined the military, and we decided she would be a stay at home Mom). Now my kid is an adult (19) but she’s been home so long, she wouldn’t be get a job that pays more than hourly if she ever went back to work.  Which also causes me anxiety. How are we ever going to retire if she barely worked and won’t have anything for retirement. My 19yr old had no idea what they want to do in life. They’ve hardly even had a job, and quit college after a semester.  It’s all on me. \n\nThose friends and family members who lost their jobs, all had working spouses to lean on. I have nothing holding me up if I fail. It’s so much pressure I can’t sleep and I don’t know what to do. The VA is horrid for mental health care.  My Psychiatrist is 100yrs old and spends most of our quarterly Zoom appointments ranting about technology. There’s zero therapy involved at all. So I’m on my own again. \n\nI’m not suicidal, but I’ve had plenty of thoughts that I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow to alleviate this anxiety. Part of me believes that’s why I eat so poorly. Maybe a coronary is the quickest way out without actually quitting. I would give anything for a peaceful nights sleep, or to be the type of person who doesn’t have this constant anxiety. \n\nHas anyone found success in coping with thoughts like these? If so, what’s your secret?",

I am very prone to self sabotage/ have experience with SH addiction to cope in my youth so now, being a young adult, i feel rendered helpless and have immensely poor coping skills; i had debilitating anxiety freshman year of high school i think that stunted me as well because i could not speak to strangers at all. i honestly fit the demographic for borderline perfectly and i just get so rash and erratic and emotional.\n\ni’m old enough now where i know the life changes and transitions will be ok, it’s not the end of the world, there’s plenty of fish in the sea to swim with, but it’s really hard. i feel like my heart is in my chest constantly and my stomach is being nagged, anxiety around easy confrontation of mutual friends of the people that left leaves my limbs shaking violently, i can’t stomach food— sometimes it comes back up because of my nerves without me wanting to. and i just feel really stunted i thought i was doing well but i was really reliant and not a good partner to either of these people. my father is sober now, he says not to take control of the situation.\ni’m taking 15 mg lexapro but it kind of just barely keeps the edge off to help with said addiction. i have been clean for over a year though but i do cope in other ways, such as daily weed smoking, sometimes in bad moments hitting myself but it’s ok  fr i try not to and i do good. But the nagging … the nerves, the constant on edge and questioning myself, the fear of strangers and the unknown, it’s so hard. Just hate fighting my body to not do something irrational. \n\n(extra context, i go to art school with my recent ex S, i didn’t mean to break up i kind of split on her on aug 1 though; we are roommates, she blocked me, it’s because of my past complicated relationship with the other friend J, who is kind of my ex too, we went to the same school, and it all kind of crumbled when i was given an ultimatum to cut off the person by my gf at the time. and i wasn’t sure what to do with that grief of J because we lived together and all these things and he helped me with my SH addiction and i was very intertwined with his family, they gave me easter baskets and brought me to vacations, but like i don’t know if it was romantic emotionally but it was some sort of weirdness confusion I don’t know if i like guys. But we were super close and physically intimate too but fell off this past year [went no contact for a second but i broke it when i found out he was confiding in my gf being high risk suicidal] [rlly complicated] but i uhhh hung out with him and lied about it and i handled it so poorly. and it’s all being left that i was a cheater and never was fully committed to her. i love S so dearly i wasn’t aware of the mistakes i was making until it was immensely late. so yeah S is my roommate and we’re living together and it’s awkward she doesn’t even acknowledge my presence most of the time although we were friends for years. it’s okay)\n\ni have an appointment with a psychologist next week so we will see.

    "title": "SS worried, also just worried about my medication’s in general.",
    "selftext": "Hello my fellow worried warriors,\n\nLike the header says I’m worried about serotonin syndrome. I am just starting my increase of mirtazapine. I’ve been on it two weeks and last night just jumped from 15 mg to 30. \n\nI just wanted to give you some background. It’s a bit long and conflated so bear with me. \n\nThe beginning of this month I hit my absolute peak of anxiety. It had been steadily building since end of May. I was on lexapro 20mg daily for about a year with MUCH success. Unfortunately, I started to have extreme stomach pain 4 months in, and would be cramping to the point I would end up in the hospital. \n\nFor the good part of the year, we thought it was the startings of ulcerative colitis, maybe it was IBS, even Crohn’s. I had a endoscopy and colonoscopy. Both came back with unclear answers. There were some lesions in the bowel, but it was not enough to be causing the pain that I was experiencing. After my colonoscopy (middle of April), my gastrologist ordered I stop the escitalopram. So I stopped cold turkey no questions asked. I was not given another medication to ease the stoppage until beginning of May, which was amitriptyline. I’ve never had any success with amitriptyline, and tried it again with really no success.\n\nAfter stopping Lexapro, my anxiety absolutely went through the roof with a steady decline starting to really hit end of May middle of June. This was similar to how I was feeling before taking the Lexapro, ongoing sustain panic. I quickly went to my nurse practitioner and they started me on round of clobazam, which was prescribed only for a week half( a white tablet, I forget what milligram dosage it was). Then Klonopin 1. and Klonopin .5 \n\nStarting the clobazam in the Klonopin was very worrying. I have previous addictions issues. I’m on methadone. I’ve gone from 100 mg to now 12 mg daily. I am no stranger to addiction and seen what happened to people in a benzo withdrawal. So I did not take them daily as they were prescribed. I used them only when I felt like I was needing to head to the hospital with anxiety. \n\nMy anxiety persisted, unless I took one of the benzos which I was not about to start taking every day so I went back to my nurse practitioner, and she suggested I started buspirone, which did help for a hot minute and then it quickly lost any anti-anxiety benefits. Then I tried taking pregabalin which I had some success, but it quickly started to inducing anxiety so I had to stop immediately. I went back to the nurse practitioner and she suggest I tried to take a lesser dose of the pregabalin and Klonopin on very hard days.\n\nI have a lot of anxiety around going to work and it started to really affect my quality of life. I was able to work fine when I was on the Lexapro. If I worked three times in the week, I would have a panic for the whole week because I would start to worry about working the day before the day of work and then it would continue until I was off. And then it didn’t even matter if I was working or not I was just in extreme continued panic. I will add that. I was also losing a shit ton of hair around this time. \n\nAround August 5 I started a week of the worse sustained anxiety attack  I’ve ever experienced in my life. I literally was lying in bed, sleeping all day just to get relief. It was the only time I didn’t feel the impending doom looming over me. By the 11th I felt almost psychotic and exhausted. I was literally praying not to die or surrendering and getting myself ready to die every hour.\n\nI will say I’m seeing a nurse practitioner because to see an actual psychologist is a very long wait here in Canada. I still haven’t seen one except for the emergency appointment I got on 15 August. I can’t wait for November 28. \n\nThe nurse practitioner took me off of the pre-goblin put me on 100 mg of gabapentin three times daily and also prescribed another round of Klonopin .5. I took the Klonopin daily for about three days and the gabapentin. I was able to finally break out of my anxiety prison. \n\nI have had an emergency appointment a Psychologist and he prescribed me mirtazapine 15 mg for two weeks and then 30 mg. I have just jumped onto that 30 mg dose. While continuing the gabapentin 100 mg three times a day, and Klonopin only as needed. He also spoke to me having generalized anxiety disorder and possibly OCD. \n\nThe mirtazapine has been working I think. I haven’t fallen back into that sustained anxiety prison. But guys, I really worry about my medication’s. \n\nI’m worried about increasing the dose. I’m worried about interactions with the drugs that I’m taking. I’m worried about serotonin syndrome. \n\nI got a full blood work up probably twice during the month of August all we’re good except for my B12, which was deficient and iron, which was really deficient. I think my iron stores were at 5% at the time. So I started 300 mg of iron daily. As well as a vitamin B 12 supplement 2500 micrograms.\n\nI was also told I should try magnesium for its anti-anxiety benefits, so I started taking 200 mg of magnesium bisglycinate in the morning. \nAs well, I also take the materna multivitamin. \n\nAm I at risk? \n\nI have health anxiety. I don’t know if the symptoms I feel or real or imagined. My heart has palpitations but not sustained and kind of randomly. I also have sweaty hands and feet. I have had benefitted from the increased appetite because I’ve been underweight due to being under anxiety I cannot eat. I’ve never had trouble sleeping so the added drowsiness effect has really been no benefit. They warned me I would be very sleepy on my 15 mg dose but I found I was only sleepy for about two days and I righted myself back to normal. \n\n I worry that all my medication is going to drive me into serotonin syndrome. This is the most medication I’ve been on since I can remember along with supplements. What are some clearcut things that I should look for? If you’re in the medical profession is my regime at risk? I almost wish I didn’t jump up to the 30 but I’m still having some anxiety, but it is manageable. I don’t know. Maybe this is more of a vent. But I’m waking up this morning with a little bit of anxiety over upping my dose to 30mg of mirtazapine. \n\nI don’t know what is your experience with mirtazapine? I don’t know my rumination causes me sometimes to have anxiety spirals. And then whatever the hell else is going on with me sometimes causes sustained panic attack attacks the kind where I forget how to write sometimes I even forget how to talk. My speech comes out all jumbled. I have such a feeling to flee that I’ve gotten out of a moving car before. I’ve just got up and got out of cars at parking lights due to that overwhelming feeling of anxiety.. I don’t know what the heck is all going on with me, but I’m interested to see what a Psychologist would say AFTER actually spending some good time with me. \n\nPhew that was long anyway anyways if you made it this far, thank you for just listening! \n\n\n\n",

My biggest challenge being short of breath. Like i’m sucking on air through one of those coffee stirrer straws. Getting not enough air and not being able to get a good deep breath sends me into a panic and I assume i’m dying. But then i get through it. Next day, it happens again, sometimes several times. Everyday I feel like i’m dying. I go through phases, I’ll feel better alittle bit if im relaxing and laying down watching a movie, but then all of a sudden I get the weirdest feeling in my chest like theres an alien about to jump out and it jolts me up. This also happens when I’ve been sleeping the last week, it’s like i can start to fall asleep, breathing in and out of my nose (best method for anxiety apparently) but then as soon as I almost fall asleep completely my breathing is so unregulated and i don’t have enough Co2 or something that my body jolts awake and i have this warmth in my chest. So i haven’t slept much at all recently. I haven’t been to work or seen my boyfriend/friends in weeks. I’m so scared. The fear of something being seriously wrong with me has reverted me back into being a hypochondriac. I have severe health anxiety after getting a blood clot two years ago even tho it was eliminated and i was cleared for it. Went to the ER 4 fucking times in the last 3 weeks, cat scans, x rays, blood work, ekgs. Everything is normal. So why do I feel like i’m dying. And the feeling of this is making me actually want to die now but also so scared of it. I definitely had years worth of unchecked anxiety just all catch up to me one day and ever since then it’s been like a living nightmare. Anyone have any similar experiences or just any advice i’m desperate at this point. ",

    "selftext": "40yo female here. I’ve been living with my boyfriend for 3.5 years, been together for over five. There are cycles with his personality where he’s either a great partner or then he’s manic and yelling, cursing, not sleeping and suicidal. I think he’s triggered by living paycheck to paycheck (I cover almost everything from groceries, majority of rent, loaning him cash, dining out, and I’m ok with parts of that because I make more money and am older). The other trigger is when he can’t get a refill on his Xanax.\n\nHe refuses to go on an SSRI. Only will do Xanax. Can one be addicted to Xanax? Can not having it readily available trigger a manic episode? His episodes lasts days, sometimes weeks. I try to handle everything in life for him. Today for example, I went grocery shopping so that he wasn’t upset that there was no drinks or food in the house. But because I went in the middle of the day, I also had a lot of work to catch up on after. He told me he was starving so at 5pm I started cooking dinner for him. When I finished, he was napping. So I took the dog out for a walk and kept the food wrapped in foil. I am about to come back in with the dog and he calls me on the phone: \n“Where are you?”\n“I’m unlocking the door just about to come in with the dog”\nHe hangs up. \nI come to the kitchen where he’s eating the dinner I cooked. No thank you for grocery shopping, for cooking dinner, for walking the dog, for taking the trash out. Instead, he starts yelling at me. He claims I sounded frustrated when I picked up the phone. I was not frustrated. He asked what happened - nothing happened. Nothing is wrong. But he is projecting and coming at me with yelling and cursing at me and the dog. \n\nI know he’s stressed, I know he’s depressed, and I am doing all I can to help. But could it be a withdrawal? Could Xanax or fear of not having Xanax cause manic episodes? I want to understand why he has to get so angry. Especially when there’s nothing to be angry about - he’s in his head about things (like me being “frustrated” when I answered the phone). \n\nAnyone have similar experiences?

    "selftext": "I literally can't do this anymore. Me and this man have been in a relationship for the past 4 months. I wish my boyfriend had a normal girlfriend. I ruminate and overthink everything. The more I find myself trusting him the more scared I get. I always have this feeling everytime he is nice to me that something terrible is about to happen. The thing is he is always nice to me. He never does anything bad to me. He respects me a lot and supports me. He is convinced we are in a happy and healthy relationship, but when he isn't around I want to throw up. It's like my mind is only truly quiet, when I am with him. I always think he is going to let go of me and if I convince myself he won't do that then I'm afraid I'm going to leave him. I don't even want to think about what would happen to him if I left so suddenly. He is literally all I have and he finds so much strenght in me it hurts. I wonder if there is another soulmate outthere for me. And I dont think that soulmate would be kinder or better, but a better fit in some karmic way, if that makes any sense. I just feel like I am not deserving of all that kindness and sweetness. The thing is I want only this man that I have. I want to see him grow out of his depression and I want to see him achieve his dreams no matter how hard it is. I want to be a better girlfriend for him, but I can become that only if I become more myself. Only if I start living in the moment and not think about future disappointments, to which there are no indications. I dissasociate when I'm with him sometimes and enjoy our moments retroactively. He keeps checking on me and I am so afraid he will take my anxiety personally and abandon me because of he will feel it's for my own good. I feel like because of it he won't be able to see how much I truly appreciate him. He already sometimes thinks I'm not satisfied with him. I just don't know how to be happy and in a way I am using him as exposure therapy and am trying to teach myself to be happy, but I feel guilty for this too. I don't know how to stop feeling anxious and I don't know how to live in the moment and nothing helps. No breathing exercices, the therapy... it's all for nothing. My therapist says to get more therapy, but that's so expensive it makes me more depressed. AAAAAAAAAAA",

    "selftext": "\n\nThere will definitely be some triggering stuff as I’m wanting to describe my anxiety. \n\n\nThis is unbearable and I honestly believe that my depression is because of my anxiety. I feel INCOMPATIBLE with life. \n\nThe racing heart, elephant on my chest, heart palpitations, constantly monitoring every little sensation in my body. Can’t feel my heart pounding out of my chest? Oh must be something wrong, gotta panic now. Heart pounding out of my chest? Oh it’ll never stop and only get faster and then I’m gonna go into cardiac arrest and die. Weird sensation in my stomach? Must be my appendix rupturing and I’m gonna be too scared to go to the hospital and die. Slept on my arm weird so now it hurts? Probably arm pain caused by HEART ATTACK. I feel like my body isn’t actually mine most the time or like I’m not real. That I’ll never get it to calm down. And with every panic attack I’m convinced I’m going to die. Someone rubs my skin the wrong way, I touch something weirdly textured, or my feet get dry and touch and I’m FREAKING OUT. \n\nIt never stops. Lights are too bright, everything is too loud. People looking at me makes me extremely uncomfortable. I’m a sahm so i keep myself in the house as much as humanly possible- I’m talking I can go weeks without leaving and just have my partner take the kids out so they actually get to enjoy life. Me? My bed is my bestfriend, under the covers, watching movies, trying not to panic or dissociate. I clean and cook, play with the kids but every little moment between is me hiding away from the world. \n\nI rock back and forth, I’ve even sucked my thumb like I did as a child, hide under my pillow, dumped ice cold water on myself, paced. I got to a point once where I was open to medication after a bad experience, got on Prozac, TERRIBLE idea, it reset my progress and made my anxiety significantly worse and my HR was at like 160 constantly. I’m too scared to try again. \n\nI feel extremely depressed. I can’t walk long periods of time outside without feeling like my legs are gonna give up. I don’t want to pick things up because I feel my arms are gonna give up. I don’t want to eat because I’m scared I’ll go into anaphylactic shock and die so I have to wait 5mins after each bite when I try new foods. Huge phobia of doctors and hospitals. I’ve lost 20lbs. I only eat my safe foods. I never feel like I’ve closed a door right, or flushed the toilet right, or hm did I leave the oven that I haven’t touched in days on? Gotta go check a few times. \n\nExtreme obsessive thoughts about every negative interaction I’ve ever had. I isolate myself from other adults (or kids, except my own, really just people in general) hate going to the bathroom because I feel claustrophobic and like I can’t escape. Can’t go in a car without severe panic attacks because the same thing. I even hate the bath now which used to comfort me. \n\nMovies, tv shows, music, sometimes cleaning helps, ASMR, and good tea seems to help. A good nights sleep helps which I rarely get because I’m plagued by nightmares and my body jerks itself out of sleep a lot. I need any natural remedies or just any suggestions. \n\nI used to drink to cope, conversations were tolerable, rarely anxious, but from my severe trauma I was becoming suicidal and I have been sober for months and have no interest in picking that back up. \n\nI don’t drink coffee bc caffeine makes me extremely anxious but I do have a major nicotine addiction. \n\nCan’t smoke weed either because it’s always only ever given me panic attacks. Ugh. \n\nI’m exhausted all the time from constantly being on edge or panicking. \n\nI NEED A HUG (but not really, I don’t like being touched) ",

I suffer from anxiety and depression resulting in me taking the maximum amount of venlafaxine and the jury is still out on whether bispirone is doing anything yet. My wife also suffers from depression.\n\nMy job pays ok for being a non professional position but my wife makes about $4 more an hour than me and I would argue her job is a lot easier than mine and she gets to work from home. Needless to say, I don’t care for my job even though the schedule is nice.\n\nMy 83 year old grandfather is dying and I doubt that he’ll make it to October. Our house is always a mess. Not disgusting or needs to be condemned but just messy usually from the cats and the dog tearing things up. Part of the problem is our kids do sports and cheer so we’re pretty busy during the week. The other part is laziness (see depression).\n\nWhen I was in school I was always told how smart I was and how I was going to be successful in life. I don’t think I’ve lived up to that at all. A successful person wouldn’t have a dirty house, over $10k in credit card debt, and a job as a stocker.\n\nSo I don’t know if I’m nervous,anxious, or depressed. I have a constant tightness in my chest anymore. I worry about having enough money, about finding a better job, my grandfather dying, making the family happy and providing for them, not really having savings, the state of the house. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t really want to die but I don’t see much point in living. I want to be happy again.",

    "selftext": "[This is my throwaway account because my friend follows my normal one]\n\nSo I met a friend one day, towards the middle of January, he slipped me a note that read “take if you aren’t okay”\n\nI struggle with depression myself so I took it, part as a joke, part not. We hadn’t talked before, but I decided to give it a try\n\nI have pretty bad trust issues, so I was keeping my guard up, but I didn’t get any immediate gut feelings or bad thoughts, which was strange\n\nWell we started talking through notes, and I eventually suggested texting, so we exchanged numbers\n\nHe asked for small favors like talking longer, and thanked me for simply being there and talking. One day he asked for a hug.\n\nI immediately said “sure” happily. This guy had gained my trust almost immediately, and we had grown closer very very quickly\n\nWell I had learned that I was the first person to hug him besides some family, as he had some fairly family issues. Hugging became a daily thing, it made him happy, and him being happy made me happy. Of course, I liked the hugs too, but I got hugs regularly so they where nice but not new. I had rarely got hugs like that before, and one day he asked a question by writing it out. He asked for a whole hug, which meant longer then before\n\nBut I took it as two arms instead of a side hug\n\nSo this became a really special thing, and he waited for me after school to get a hug and say goodbye\n\nWell one day he had a note for me, which we didn’t do often anymore\n\nSo I read it, and he said that on March 15 he was going to kill himself\n\nI was shocked. I knew he struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts and cut, but I had no clue he was going to take his own life\n\nHe told me he didn’t because of me\n\nMe.\n\nNow I doubt it was fully me\n\nYes, I was there for him\n\nGave him some physical affection\n\nBut that was a terrifying thought to think of\n\nA little later I managed to get him to promise not to cut or harm himself\n\nFast forward a couple months to last night,\n\nHe texted me at around 9:40 pm about his friend being a jerk\n\nSaying that this was the time he was going to block him\n\nA bit later he had what I think was a “small” panic attack\n\nPeople where being absolute dicks. I don’t know what they said, but his very own friends convinced him to stay in his room, door locked\n\nHe told me he wasn’t going to eat\n\nNot going to drink\n\nThis scared me. Essentially he was going to let himself die of thirst in his room\n\nI was trying to talk him out of it, and he was saying all these things like “it’s fine, you can replace me” “it’ll be better that way”\n\nI was sobbing by midnight, desperately trying to get him to change his mind\n\nI had lost most of my energy, throat closing up, aching, just all in all a mess\n\nI couldn’t convince him I needed him here, I told him I loved him, (like family, I think of him like a brother), told him he’s one in a billion and can’t be replaced no matter how cheesy it sounds. Instead, I managed to guilt him.\n\nI feel like shit about it, as I hate guilting people, but he said it’s fine and it works\n\nWe talked a little longer, we had both calmed down, and went to bed around 1 am\n\nIn the morning I asked if he had eaten\n\nHe said no.\n\nAsked if he had drank anything\n\nHe said no.\n\nBut he told me he had left his room\n\nThat was a good start, so I was happy\n\nA little bit later he told me he had eaten and drank some water\n\nTL;DR: I guilted/convinced my friend whom I think of like a brother to eat and drink again, and I’m proud, but now I’m extra cautious and I’m worried it’ll happen again\n\nYou aren’t alone, nobody.
